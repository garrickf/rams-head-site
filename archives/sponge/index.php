<p>Welcome to the Spontaneous Generation Archives. The hope with
these is that they will be updated quarterly by the producer and
the last director and then presented to the members, particularly
the list of games and taboos. If everybody just adds to the
existing text and signs their name at the end, this should remain
both informative and organized.</p>

<p><b>History.</b> Karen Horwitz and I met at the beginning of
1991 with the idea of starting a comedy troupe on campus. Our
original concept was that a collection of actors, writers, and
perhaps musicians would meet at least once a week for a workshop
under a single rehearsal director. The workshop would be in two
parts. First, it would be a workout using improv games. Perhaps
this section would inspire the writers and musicians to put some
scenes down on paper for the following week. Second, it would be
a scripted rehearsal based on whatever the writers had developed
from previous workshops or from writers' meetings of their own.
Every few weeks, a performance director would be named, someone
other than the rehearsal director. This person would collect a
smaller group from within the larger one and pick scenes to
perform in dorm shows which were combinations of improv and
scripted material. This job would be rotating so that it would be
only a temporary time commitment for the director, who might hold
extra rehearsals for the performers during the week. Also, since
the show would change completely every few weeks, it would allow
for actors and writers to be involved only when their schedules
allowed. Otherwise, the weekly workshop was a small enough time
commitment to keep the larger group together.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, we began our weekly workshops on Sunday
nights from 7:30 to 9:30pm, and <b>Spontaneous Generation</b> was
born. I was the weekly rehearsal director, William Thomas was the
first performance director, and Doug Dorst lead the group of
writers. Very quickly, the basic format was changed to reflect
the most successful facets of the group. The writers quickly
vanished, and with them went the prospects for scripted material.
The rotating director then became a one-performance commitment,
and as the group pared down to ten or fifteen committed members,
extra rehearsals became unnecessary, since we had all worked with
one another sufficiently in the weekly rehearsals. We were most
successful with about a single dorm performance a week, and
almost all of the regular members got a chance to direct one of
these before the end of the 90-91 school year. Still, the weekly
workshops were considered completely open, and very often we were
pleased to have a new member or two at these meetings. Showing up
was the only requirement we had for membership, although
eventually we got nifty jerseys with the group name on it, and
the financial cost of these jerseys tended to separate the casual
visitor from the more committed members. At the end of spring,
Jason Dell was named the new quarterly rehearsal director, and
Karen intended to continue as Manager. </p>

<p>While the group was very successful in its first year, several
ideas remain unexplored which I don't think should be forgotten
quite yet. The challenge still remains to incorporate scripted
material into the performances and welcome writers back into the
group. Also, will the performances remain only in dorms, or will
we one day see an all-campus performance in Ricker or some other
space? At lunch time in White Plaza? Karen's original goal for
the group was to use such a show to raise money for charity.
Also, the role of the group as a Ram's Head Special Project has
not been well defined--we even forgot to put &quot;Ram's
Head&quot; on our jerseys. Will music eventually become a part of
our performances? Finally, what strategies will be used to
recruit new members? We are still largely unknown on campus, and
our open invitations go largely unanswered. The goals of the
group will change as its members do. These ideas are only
suggestions; they may or may not be appropriate to the group's
future. Remember that we have a good thing going here. </p>

<p>Hi! I'm Tony, SponGe's producer for the '96-'97 school year.
I'm really excited to be more involved with SponGe this year, and
hope to overcome a few challenges to make it a really great and
well known organization. Karen Bergstrom has agreed to direct
Fall quarter, and she is fantastic. One of our first projects has
been to get as many new recruits as possible. Our ideas for
getting people at the beginning of the year are contacts with
RAs, random appearances at house meetings, activities fair, white
plaza shows(?) and more. And we will definitely have T-shirts, as
soon as I figure out a design.</p>

<p>I forsee some new life for SponGe this year, although it will
be hard Fall quarter without Raj's help. Gaieties will be
awesome, though, I'm sure. Come and see us this year, and help us
make it a great one! </p>

<p>Fall Quarter has been going well. We are ready to have our new
recruits show. Excitement extraordinaire! </p>

<p>Well, fall quarter's over. The new people are wonderful, and
the group is really coming along. We've got a kind of chemistry
that works. YAY Sponge!</p>

<p>Much passage of time... well, the year's over, and it was a
wonderful experience. Sponge has a lot of great new members, and
next year ('97-'98) should be fantastic. Jon Hsy, a regular
Sponge member is producing, and Risa Okimoto will be directing.</p>
