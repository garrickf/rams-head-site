  <meta property="og:description" content="Hollywood, the 1940s: novelist Stine drafts a screenplay for demanding film producer Buddy. As Stine writes and rewrites, the events of his script unfold: stunning Alaura Kingsley solicits private eye Stone to investigate the disappearance of her stepdaughter Mallory. It does not take long for Stone to realize that this femme fatale is offering him a lot more than he bargained for. Winner of six Tony Awards, City of Angels is a sexy mix of jazz, noir, innuendo and cheeky humor." />
