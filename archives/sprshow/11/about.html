<h1>about</h1>
<p>A musical thriller, Stephen Sondheim's and Hugh Wheeler's heart-pounding masterpiece of murderous barber-ism and culinary crime, “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” tells an infamous tale: an unjustly exiled barber returns to 19th century London seeking revenge against the lecherous judge who framed him and abducted his young wife. Sweeney's thirst for blood soon grows to include his unfortunate customers, and Mrs. Lovett, the resourceful proprietor of the pie shop downstairs, has London addicted to her mysterious new meat pie recipe!</p>

<p>Ram’s Head Theatrical Society, Stanford University’s oldest and largest student- run theatre group, has been committed to producing the outstanding theatre such as “Sweeney Todd” since 1959, when the organization put on its first student- produced, -directed, -designed, and -performed musical. Ram’s Head’s size and renown have grown immensely over the last 50 years, as it has gained national reputefor its annual Big Game Gaieties, Original Winter One-Acts, and professional-style spring musical performed in Stanford’s largest indoor theater, Memorial Auditorium. Past Ram’s Head spring musicals have included “West Side Story,” “A Chorus Line,” “Pippin,” “Evita,” “Jesus Christ Superstar,” "Guys and Dolls," "Company,” “Cabaret,” Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Aida,” and “Into the Woods.”</p>
