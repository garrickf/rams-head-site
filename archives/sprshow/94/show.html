Below, the cast of <cite>Guys and Dolls</cite> frolics on the Downtown set,
one of four major sets built for the show.  We purchased a new drop,
seen in the background, which was painted to allow light to come
through in some areas.  When backlit, the lights of the city appeared
to glow.  The effect was accompanied by chaser lights on the folding
flats stage left and right.  The folding flats were also rigged to fly,
allowing minimal use of blackouts.

Hey!  Who let that photographer in here!  No pictures!<p>

On the right, Harry the Horse (Adrian Khactu '95) gives Big Julie
(Atim Udoffia '95) a Big Hug.  <p>

Adrian and Atim later went on to staff positions in Ram's Head, as
Director and Co-Choreographer respectively for Big Game Gaieties '94:
<cite>Natural Born Gaieties</cite>.  <p>

Ram's Head encourages people of all backgrounds to audition and apply
for positions on our production staffs.  We often cast
non-traditionally with respect to both race and sex.  Like they say,
&quot;If you gots the talent, you gots the part!&quot;

  Dave Barlin '95 trying his hand at power tools. Does he know what he's doing?</p>
<p>Our biggest build time for Spring Show is usually during Spring Break, when everyone in
  the staff (yes, even bigshots like Dave) hangs around campus to screw. </p>

<p>Ram's Head offers tremendous opportunities for students to become involved either in
  the technical or performing side of theatre, regardless of seniority. Marnie was just a
  frosh when she ASM'd <cite>Guys and Dolls</cite> in '94.</p>
<p>The following season, she TD'd Gaieties '94, and also served on the Executive Staff as
  Box Office Manager. <br clear="right">

  Hoffman, actor Jeff Meador '95 underwent a gruesome physical and psychological
  transformation to become Nicely-Nicely Johnson. Here we see him at his most frightening.</p>
<p>Many Ram's Hedons are active both onstage and backstage. Jeff's first show with us was
  as propsmaster for Gaieties '91. He then appeared in <cite>Little Shop of Horrors</cite>,
  Gaieties '92, and <cite>Guys and Dolls</cite> before returning backstage as Ram's Head's
  Executive Producer for the '94-'95 season. </p>
