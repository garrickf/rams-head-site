Below, the cast of <cite>Guys and Dolls</cite> frolics on the Downtown set,
one of four major sets built for the show.  We purchased a new drop,
seen in the background, which was painted to allow light to come
through in some areas.  When backlit, the lights of the city appeared
to glow.  The effect was accompanied by chaser lights on the folding
flats stage left and right.  The folding flats were also rigged to fly,
allowing minimal use of blackouts.

On the right, Harry the Horse (Adrian Khactu '95) gives Big Julie
(Atim Udoffia '95) a Big Hug.  <p>

Adrian and Atim later went on to staff positions in Ram's Head, as
Director and Co-Choreographer respectively for Big Game Gaieties '94:
<cite>Natural Born Gaieties</cite>.  <p>

Ram's Head encourages people of all backgrounds to audition and apply
for positions on our production staffs.  We often cast
non-traditionally with respect to both race and sex.  Like they say,
&quot;If you gots the talent, you gots the part!&quot;  <p>
