of Angels</a></h1>

<hr>

<p>City of Angels sets its mood immediately, with a Robin Wagner set (half-architecture,
half-movie poster) that extends into the theatre, and a musical &quot;Prologue: Theme from
City of Angels&quot; that incorporates orchestra, scat vocals, and a suitably world-weary
voice over-by Stone that plunges us into the realm of 1940's detective movies. </p>

<p>As the curtain rises, Stone lies on a hospital gurney with a bullet in his shoulder and
a lot on his mind. A tough private eye in the tradition of Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade,
Stone also suffers from a bruised heart (owing to a weakness for beautiful women) and an
empty wallet (he's too moral to take dishonest jobs). Stone flashes back to a week
earlier, when his secretary-with-a-heart-of-gold, Oolie, ushered in a rich, beautiful
woman named Alaura. Alaura claims she wants Stone to find her missing stepdaughter;
against his better judgment he takes the case. And just as we're becoming intrigued .... </p>

<p>A man at a typewriter appears on stage, and the actors are suddenly backing up,
&quot;rewinding&quot;, and playing the scene with a few changes. The man, we discover, is
Stine, author of popular detective novels starring Stone, one of which he is now adapting
for his first screenplay. What we've seen comes straight from his imagination. </p>

<p>Like Stone, Stine has a weakness for women, but fewer scruples when it comes to money.,
At the moment, the money is coming from Buddy Fidler, Hollywood mogul and master puppeteer
of creative people. Something telling Stine to watch out, but for now, he's just enjoying
the ride (Double Talk). </p>

<p>Back at Stine's hotel room, we learn that the misgiving comes mostly from his wife,
Gabby who wishes Stine would stick to novels. He won't listen, thought anymore than Stone
will, and we begin to see the interplay between reality and fiction as Gabby and Oolie
lament What You Don't Know About Women. </p>

<p>The mystery resumes, with Stone, alone in his dreary bungalow, listening to crooner
Jimmy Powers and the Angel City 4 brightly telling their radio audience You Gotta Look Out
For Yourself which takes on a certain poignancy when two hoods break down his door and
beat him up. </p>

<p>Cut to Buddy reading this scene in the screenplay: we see that his secretary Donna is
the model for Oolie, and that Buddy can't help fiddling with everything, in the song The
Buddy System. </p>

<p>And back to Stone, out cold, being rudely awakened by LAPD Lt. Munoz, who was Stone's
partner on the force but now bears him a major grudge. Stone, it seems, loved a low-rent
lounge singer named Bobbi whom we see performing a torchy ballad With Every Breath I Take.
But Bobbi wanted stardom more than marriage, and when Stone caught her with a Hollywood
producer tempers flared, a gun went off and the producer was dead of a
&quot;heart-attack&quot; caused by two bullets. Munoz has never forgiven Stone for
&quot;getting away&quot; with murder and would gladly nail him for jaywalking. </p>

<p>Stone, angry about the beating, confronts Allure at her mansion and meets several more
unsavory characters, including her lustful stepson, her war-profiteer husband, and the
quack spiritualist who attends him. Greed and malice hover like smog, but Alaura's
considerable charm and bankroll keep Stone on the case, resulting in The Tennis Song. </p>

<p>Stone fruitlessly pursues the missing step-daughter, Mallory (Everybody's Gotta Be
Somewhere) in a scene that recalls a film montage, only to find her waiting in his bed,
signing Lost and Found. Stone somehow manages to resist temptation ... </p>

<p>Which is more than can be said for his creator. His wife having returned to New York,
Stine takes comfort in Donna's bed, although not without some guilt. But this is
Hollywood, after all, where no one's motives are pure ... </p>

<p>As Stone quickly learns, when a photographer breaks in, snaps him with Mallory, and she
runs off with his gun, which is used to murder the quack. Stone finds himself framed for
the filling and is gleefully arrested by Munoz (All You Have to Do is Wait) </p>

<p>Not that Stine is having such a great time either. Buddy is butchering his scripts, his
conscience is nagging and Stone, his own creation, is disgusted with him. The curtain
falls with each of them arguing in You Nothing Without Me. </p>

<p>Act II opens in what appears to be Alaura's bedroom, but proves to actually belong to
Carla Haywood, Buddy's wife, who will play Alaura in the movie. </p>

<p>Stone, meanwhile, languishes in jail, attended only by Oolie, who like her alter ego,
Donna, is feeling used by men (You Can Always Count On Me). Stone is mysteriously bailed
out, but the two hoods catch up with him and nearly blow him up before he neatly turns the
tables. </p>

<p>Stine has troubles of his own. Lonely at a lavish Hollywood party of Buddy's
sycophants, including a typical Hollywood composer (Alaura's Theme) Stine calls home only
to find that Gabby has discovered his affair with Donna. He flies to New York with an
elaborately prepared excuse, but she's not buying (It Needs Work). </p>

<p>Stone, fighting now to clear his name, is lead to a brothel where he is stunned to find
Bobbie. We learn it was she who shot the producer; Stone has been covering for her all
this time. Together they face the wreckage of their love (With Every Breath I Take). </p>

<p>Oolie, meanwhile has made her own discovery: Alaura is a fortune hunter who has already
murdered one rich husband and planned to do away with this one, once she had eliminated
his son, daughter and doctor. Stone confronts her at the mansion; they grapple for her
gun; shots ring out ... and Alaura falls dead, Stone's gravely wounded and we're back
where we started. </p>

<p>But where does that leave Stine? His wife has rejected him, his lover, Donna has also
been rewriting his script; Stine faces the collapse of his real and fictive worlds and as
his emotions take over, his wit turns bitter (Funny). </p>

<p>When he arrives on the movie set to find that Buddy's name appears above his one the
screen-play, and that the shallow crooner Jimmy Powers will play Stone, Stine boils over,
With the help of Stone, he rages at Buddy gets himself fired, and is about to be pounded
on by two security guards when Stone somehow appears at Stine's typewriter and writes him
the fighting skills of a superhero, then tacks on a Hollywood ending, where Gabby returns,
forgiving all. The entire casts assembles onstage to celebrate, singing I'm Nothing
Without You as the curtain falls. </p>

<p><b>THE END!</b> </p>
