<p style='text-indent:.5in'>At the beginning of the show, We are
greeted by actors of the Music Hall Royale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
actors led by the Chairman welcome the audience to the musical hall (“There You
Are”)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:20.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Act 1<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>


<p style='text-indent:.5in'>The story then begins in earnest
with Edwin Drood preparing to leave for Egypt to build the Cairo Transverse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Drood arrives at his Uncle Jasper’s house
where they affirm their friendship (“Two Kinsmen”).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We then see the fair Miss Rosa Budd at her music lesson where she
is forced to sing the music teacher’s (the very same Mr. John Japser) new
composition (“Moonfall”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After meeting
the landless twins, we travel to the London opium den of the mysterious
Princess Puffer where she warns us of the “Wages of Sin”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We then discover that John Jasper is one of
Puffer’s clients and after he drinks some laudanum we see “Japser’s
Vision”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>We then return to lovely
Cloisterham, where Drood, and Neville get into one of there many fights about
Rosa, Neville is infatuated to say the least; Drood is not amused, and Drood,
Rosa, and Rev. Crisparkle remind the Landless twins that as they are from Cylon
they are only colonialists and not truly English (“A British Subject”).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After Drood and Rosa run off with Neville
and Helena following, John Jasper and Mayor Thomas Sapsea remind us all that
there are two sides to every man (“Both Sides of the Coin”).</p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>It is now Christmas Eve and we join
Drood and Rosa taking a nice even stroll through the Cloisterham cemetery…
after talking for a few moments they realize that they are both unhappy about
their coming marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If they had only
been “Perfect Strangers” then things might have been different, they are more
like brother and sister than soon to be husband and wife.</p>


<p style='text-indent:.5in'>A short time later, we find
ourselves at John Jasper’s house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Drood, Rosa, Neville, Helena and Rev. Chrisparkle are all there for
Christmas dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, after Japser
serves them some more potent wine (ok, it’s laudanum), and a fight ensues, but
we are reminded that “No Good Can Come from Bad”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>After dinner all part ways, and as Drood leave to take a walk
down to the River, there is burst of lightening and an ominus crash of thunder,
and as drood walkes into the night it is the last we will ever see of him…</p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>The next morning, the storm has
passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is no sign of Drood.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A mob going and tracks down Neville as he
was the last person seen with Drood, and their rivalry is well know, however
they must release him for there is not body and without a body there can be no
proof of murder.</p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>The Music Hall Royale then takes a
short break.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First to give one of there
own his 15 minutes of fame (“Never The Luck”), and then to to remind the
audience to be led, “Off to the Races”.</p>



<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:20.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Act 2<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>



<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We begin at
two at the Cloisterham train station were a train is just arriving…<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘Two enquiring sleuths are about to appear
on the scene’ one is the Princess Puffer, the other is a mysterious man called
Dick Datchery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They have arrived in
Cloisterham to begin “A Private Investigation”.</p>


<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The next
night we find that John Jasper has tracked down Rosa Budd in the streets of
Cloisterhan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He confesses his love for
her but she rejects the wicked man (“The Name of Love” &amp; “Moonfall
(reprise)”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the scene in the
street clears, Puffer tells us ”Don’t Quit While Your Ahead.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This builds into a full-fledged production
number, and then the show collapses. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We
have reached the end of Dickens’ unfinished novel.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Therefore the Players of the Music Hall Royale to vote not only
on who is the murder, but also on the real identity of the detective Dick
Datchery as he must be one of the characters we have met previously…<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And finally on a pair of lovers for the
evening.</p>


<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The ended
chosen by the audience is then preformed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Firth though we hear “Puffer’s Revolation” and how she was led down “The
Garden Path to Hell”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Datchery then
tell how Jasper is “Out on a Limerick”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Jasper is then dragged on stage where he confesses (“Japser’s Confession”)
but Durdles, the drunken Cloisterham gravedigger says that Jasper is not the
real killer and names the audiences choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Murderer then Confesses to his crime (“Murderer’s Confession”).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The murderer is dragger off.</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then so
that we have a happy ending at the Music Hall Royale, the chosen lovers sing a
love song (“Perfect Stangers” [reprise]).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And just when you thought the evening was over, young Edwin Drood
returns from beyond the grave, to say that though he has seen “The Writing on the
Wall”, that you would persevere though it all and you come out ok, ‘or
something along those lines’.</p>
