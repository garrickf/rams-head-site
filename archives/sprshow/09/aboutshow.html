												<span class="yellow"><font size="2">AIDA is a rock musical in two acts based on Giuseppe Verdi's Italian-language opera by the same name. &nbsp;The musical was produced by Disney Theatrical, with music by Elton John, lyrics by Tim Rice, and book by Linda Woolverton, Robert Falls, and David Henry Hwang. &nbsp;AIDA was Disney Theatricals' third venture on Broadway. Following the phenomenal success of both BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE LION KING, AIDA was the company's first show aimed at a more mature audience.&nbsp;<br>
													</font></span></p>
											<p><span class="yellow"><font size="2">Originally titled&nbsp;<i>Elaborate Lives&nbsp;</i>, the show premiered at Atlanta's Alliance Theater in October of 1998. This first incarnation starred Heather Headley as Aida, Sherie Renee Scott as Amneris, and Hank Stratton as Radames. Just days after the Atlanta run, Disney reshuffled almost the entire creative team, naming a new director, (Robert Falls), choreographer (Wayne Cilento) and designer (Bob Crowley). It was also at this time that the name was changed from&nbsp;<i>Elaborate Lives</i>&nbsp;to simply AIDA.&nbsp;<br>
														<br>
														In March of 1999, an all-star album featuring songs from the upcoming musical was released, with &quot;Written in the Stars&quot;, a duet by Elton John and country superstar Lee Ann Rimes, becoming the breakout hit. The song stayed at number two on the Billboard charts for four weeks.&nbsp;<br>
														<br>
														Disney decided that the show needed another out of town tryout, this time in Chicago. Heather Headley and Sherie Renee Scott would both reprise their roles, with Radames now portrayed by Adam Pascal, of RENT fame. During the second preview, there was a near disastous accident, when a set piece malfunctioned, and Headley and Pascal were thrown nearly eight feet from their &quot;tomb&quot; on to the stage. Luckily, neither actor was seriously injured and previews resumed a few days later. The production officially opened at Chicago's restored Palce Theater on December 1, 1999 and played the windy city for two months.&nbsp;<br>
														<br>
														After the Chicago engagement, the creative team continued to ready the show for Broadway. The previous summer, Disney had announced that it would move BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to the Lunt-Fonatanne Theater in order to make room for AIDA at the Palace, where it opened on March 23, 2000.&nbsp;<br>
														<br>
														AIDA was an instant audience favorite and also received 5 Tony nominations, winning for Best Original Score, Best Actress in a Musical and Best Lighting Design. The show also won the 2001 Grammy for Best Musical Show Album.&nbsp;<br>
														<br>
														A national tour was launched in the summer of 2000. and there were also international stagings in Amsterdam, Estonia, Canada, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, back on Broadway, a plethora of high profile pop stars stepped into the title role, including Toni Braxton, Michelle T. Williams and Deborah Cox.&nbsp;<br>
														<br>
														AIDA closed on Broadway on September 5, 2004, after an impressive run of 1,852 regular performances. The production was seen by over 2.5 million people and grossed over $150 million dollars.<br>
