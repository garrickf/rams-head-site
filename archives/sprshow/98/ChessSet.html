Chess began as a concept album in 1983, a collaboration between Tim Rice and the male half of ABBA.
Set in the mid-80s, the plot revolves around personal, political and romantic rivalries between Russian
and American chess champions.</td>

<td><p>Their matches serve as metaphors, each illustrating a particular dichotomy
— black vs. white, East vs. West, order vs. chaos. 
Scenes and locations cut from one to the next with cinematic frequency. 
Combined with a minimal budget, this gave rise to an abstract, sculptural set. 
It had to provide separate spaces onstage, so one scene could be pre-set in darkness while another was active. 
Sightlines suggested a raked series of levels, and an early-80s score demanded a period rock concert aesthetic.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>The final design consisted of a series of floating square black and white platforms. 
In plan, they appear as a corner of a chessboard twisting, swelling and contorting
 out of its grid in all three dimensions. In elevation, the platforms cantilever over 
each other at 18-inch intervals. A 22-foot square aluminum truss dropped most of Chess'
lighting into full view of the audience, suspended from the grid by four chain hoists installed for the production.</p>
