<p><a NAME="Director"></a>Contract For Director
<p>The director(s) is selected by the producer, Jason Mendelson, to be
in charge of the vision of Ramâs Heads Spring Musical show Pippin-. The
director(s) will follow all rules regarding the show as established by
the producer, Ramâs Head board, licensee et al. and will execute his/her/their
job in line with all rules established in this contract and future mutually
assigned contracts signed by the producer and him/her/their self.
<p>&nbsp;The director(s) will be selected by the producer to carry out
and be in charge of the vision of all artistic and interpretive elements
of the spring show in collaboration with the choreographer. The director(s)
will be in charge of artistic decisions and will be responsible for carrying
out the facilitative and administrative decisions made by the producer.
The director(s) and Choreographer will be selected before the rest of the
staff so as to provide input for the producer on the selection of the rest
of the staff. The producer will have final say on decisions regarding the
hiring of the staff. All disputes between the director(s) and the staff
should be settled between the director(s) and the staff with the understanding
that the director will have control and be responsible for the vision of
show; only the producer can override the directorâs decision, but the producer
will make every effort to not have to exercise this right. The director(s)
should make every effort to allow members of the staff to control and influence
their domain as much as possible, but the final say does belong to the
director(s). The producer may be called in to arbitrate a disagreement
or conflict between any members of the production, and has final say on
all decisions, but will make every effort to allow the staff to work out
their differences and will try to side with the director (who will have
most of the artistic control and say.) The director controls the artistic
integrity of the production.
<br>&nbsp;The director(s) have final say on all hiring of cast for the
production in conjunction with the choreographer and vocal director. (The
choreographer, vocal director, and director must be present for all auditions
and decide by January 4 2000 how auditions will be handled.) Casting will
conclude after call-backs on January 14th 2000. All three positions must
be responsible auditions and casting. Only the producer, stage manager
and assistants to the director, choreographer, and vocal director will
be allowed at auditions. Input may be obtained from the above-mentioned
participants at auditions, but the director, vocal director and choreographer
make the casting decisions.
<br>&nbsp;In addition the producer has final say over removal of staff
from their positions and removal of the director from his/her/their position,
in conjunction with the Ramâs Head board as outlined by the boardâs rules.
The removal of the director may come about in situations of irresponsibility
and failure to commit to outlined procedures. The director may not be removed
nor may the threat of removal apply to the director in cases of artistic
differences.
<br>&nbsp;The producer has final say on box office, tickets, publicity,
marketing, schedule, any thing organizational, financial or facilitative,
but input is welcome and encouraged.
<br>&nbsp;A follow up contract describing specific duties, time requirements,
and commitments will be created by the selected director(s) and the producer.

<p><a NAME="staff"></a>Contract for the Staff
<p>&nbsp;Each member of the production staff will be responsible for implementing
his/her artistic and technical interpretations of his/her domain of the
production. He/she will also be responsible for carrying out the technical
and artistic wishes of the director(s). The director(s) has final say on
all decisions regarding the artistic and technical interpretations of the
production, only the producer can override the directorâs decisions. The
director(s) also has the responsibility of listening to and trying to use
all of the assets of his/her/their production. (The most important asset
being the staff.)&nbsp; The director(s) will pay extreme attention to the
desires and opinions of his/her/their staff. The director(s) will be selected
before the rest of the staff so as to provide input for the producer on
the selection of the rest of the staff. The producer will have final say
on decisions regarding the hiring of the staff. All disputes between the
director(s) and the staff should be settled between the director(s) and
the staff with the understanding that the director(s) will have control
to make the final decision. The director(s) should make every effort to
allow members of the staff to control and influence their domain as much
as possible, with the understanding that the directors decision will probably
be the final decision, however, the final say does belong to the producer.
The Producer may be called in to arbitrate a disagreement or conflict between
any members of the production, and has the right to compel the director(s)
to make any changes in his/her/their decision, but the producer does not
want to exercise this right, except under extreme circumstances. The director
controls the artistic integrity of the production.
<br>&nbsp;The director needs to discuss staff ideas with the staff far
in advance so that artistic differences and conflicts do not arise later
on and impede rehearsals.
