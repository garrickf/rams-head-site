<p>Then you need to Hire and plan the hiring of your staff.
<br>I chose to Hire a director first to allow he/she to be part of the

<p>Try to not hire before Original Winter One Acts or at times when people
are being burned out from Gaieties
<p>Most crucial staff:
<br>Technical director and Stage Manager
