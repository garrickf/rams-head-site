<br>&nbsp;
<p>Will you let the staff contribute and control their field and department?
<p>How will you work with the staff?
<p>The problem that I have is that I know that many people will not work
on staff for this show if they feel that they will not be doing something
that have some control over· You have not yet expressed your ability to
deal with this situation.
<p>How much of a role should the staff have in the creation of the vision
of the show?
<p>How do you plan to work with me?
<p>How do you plan to incorporate different visions?
<p>How are you going to incorporate the movement of the show; the dance?
<p>How are you going to deal with a Choreographer co-equally responsible
for the vision of the show?
<p>Are you completely comfortable with the elevation of the choreographer
to the position of covisionary of the show?
<p>(How are you going to show respect to someone aiding in the vision of
the show, the hiring of the staff, the creation of the design, the casting
of the actors?)
<p>The Choreographer will be as involved in aiding in staff hiring and
in being at all design meetings and designing the show. The Director does
have final say in the case of a conflict. The director will also be in
charge of running rehearsals once they begin, but up until and even through
that point the vision of the show will be dictated by the Choreographer
and the Director together.
<p>What bothered me on Monday night was when you said that the ãchoreographerä
would come in to design ã1 element of the showä in terms of dance? Is this
what you meant to say? Can you justify your answer from Monday night. The
problem is the Choreographer is a very important and elevated position·
<br>***Where else does the choreographer come in?***
<p>Will you want an assistant director and an assistant choreographer?
Will you allow there to be people in these positions?
<p>Underlying meaning· Gay. Homosexual and sexually ambiguous theme. It
tricks people and runs throughout the show. Also the true meaning is ãYou
are F-edä the final meaning is that striving for an extraordinary life
is blah·
<p>What is your artistic vision of the show?
<p>Time commitments winter quarter·
