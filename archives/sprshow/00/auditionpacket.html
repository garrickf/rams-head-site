<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Intro"></a>Welcome to the audition information pack for Pippin,
Ramâs Head Theatrical Societyâs Spring Show for 2000. Thank you for showing
interest in the show. Ramâs Head encourages people of all background to
audition. The show will be performed in Memorial Auditorium from April
7 to April 15.
<p>We are looking for ACTORS, SINGERS, DANCERS and anyone else interested
in being a part of the most magical and vibrant musical to hit Stanford
ever. We are also seeking people with unique skills in everything from
gymnastics to contortion, puppetry to magic.
<p>Auditions will be Monday, January 10th through Wednesday, January 12th
from 6:00pm until 12:00am in Memorial Auditorium. Please arrive fifteen
minutes before your appointed audition slot with all the attached forms
filled out. You can sign up for an audition time in White Plaza at lunchtime
or at the Ramâs Head winter membership meeting or by e-mailing spiderj@leland.
<br>The audition is broken down into two parts. One part is dancing and
one part is singing and reading. Each audition will take two hours. Please
prepare a song, show tunes are preferred, but most importantly bring something
with which you are comfortable. The monologue that you will be asked to
read is attached. Please be prepared to present it. Memorization is not
necessary. Also be prepared to move.
<br>Callbacks will occur on January 13th from 6:00pm ö 12:00am. If called-back,
you will be notified by e-mail. If you are not called back you might still
be cast for the show.
<p>Rehearsals will not last for more than four hours per day and will not
occur more than 5 times a week (one of those rehearsals being either Saturday
or Sunday afternoons.) The rehearsals on weekdays will not begin before
6:00 pm and will not end after 11:00 pm. No one will be called for all
of the rehearsals.
<p>All participants in the production, cast and staff, are expected to
stay on campus during spring break.
<p>If there are any problems or concerns please feel free to discuss them
with the staff and or Producer Jason Mendelson (spiderj@leland).
<p>Thank You. Remember auditioning should be FUN!!!
