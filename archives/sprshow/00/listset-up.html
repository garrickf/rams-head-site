<br>Welcome to the Distributed Computing Group majordomo mailing
<br>list service!
<p>The services accessed via the host lists.stanford.edu have been set
up
<br>to serve as a mailing list hub for the Stanford community.
<p>Majordomo is a mail list management program that automates the routine
<br>administration of Internet mailing lists with little human
<br>intervention.&nbsp; It was written by Brent Chapman of Great Circle
<br>Associates, is supported by a group of volunteers and freely made
<br>available.&nbsp; (Thanks Brent and others!)&nbsp; This mail list manager
allows
<br>people to "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" themselves to particular
<br>mailing lists via email to the address "majordomo@lists.stanford.edu".
<br>Depending on the type of mailing list, the list owner either approves
<br>each operation or merely monitors them as they are automatically
<br>approved.&nbsp; Majordomo also automates response to certain other
common
<br>queries from users, such as a listing of all existing public mailing
<br>lists, getting list archives if available, etc.&nbsp; The majordomo
server
<br>at lists.stanford.edu has been modified for the local Stanford
<br>environment.
<p>This document is broken down into the following sections:

<br>A Service Overview and Your List
<br>---------------------------------
<p>We've been running the majordomo server since March 1993 (and the
<br>current version running has been in test since the spring of 1995).
<br>We are now offer a limited production service.&nbsp; This is a general
<br>mailing list server based on UNIX.&nbsp; This is not BITNET LISTSERV.
<br>Also, at the moment consider this to be a "best-effort" service.
<br>We're a small group and unable to provide 7-day x 24-hour coverage.
<br>Odds are good that if something breaks on Saturday it may not get
<br>looked at until Monday.&nbsp; However, we do have a vested interest
in the
<br>service; it is running our mailing lists as well as yours.&nbsp; If
you
<br>find you need a more reliable production service (like 7x24 coverage),
<br>we ask that you contact Tim Torgenrud, UNIX Workstation Support Team
<br>Manager, 3-3940, torg@netserver so he can let his management know the
<br>importance you feel this "best-effort" service should be given
<br>when resource allocation is being done.
<p>The details of how the service works are described below and in the
following
<br>pages.
<p>In your particular case, we've set up the list address
<p>&nbsp;pippin-staff@lists.stanford.edu
<p>Your password for pippin-staff@lists.stanford.edu is currently set to
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Feel free to change it.&nbsp; In fact, PLEASE change it.&nbsp; (Further
pointers
<br>on this are discussed in the Issues for Managing A Mailing List With
<br>Majordomo section.)
<p>General Policy Statements
<br>-------------------------
<p>We reserve the right to refuse to set up and/or to shutdown a mailing
<br>list using these services.
<p>If abusive behavior is being exhibited by a list member, we will place
the
<br>onus of first contact on the owner of the list.&nbsp; We reserve the
right to
<br>limit a person's posting ability and list membership if the list owner
is
<br>unable to deal with the list member.
<p>We reserve the right to remove a list from the mailing list server if
it
<br>becomes party to unreasonable or inappropriate usage of resources
<br>(unreasonable or inappropriate as defined by the staff maintaining
this server
<br>guided by the Computer Usage Policy) and discussions with the list
owner
<br>prove fruitless.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Additional Related List Addresses
<br>----------------------------------
<p>Each list has several additional addresses involved with it.&nbsp; These
<br>addresses deal with requests, ownership, and item approval for the
<br>list.&nbsp; The address owner-pippin-staff has orignally been set up
to direct
<br>all mail errors with the list to the address[es]:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spiderj@leland.stanford.edu
<p>Typical errors that are routed to the owner are the "bounced" (i.e.,
returned)
<br>mail with a secondary address due to an erroneous subscription entry
or the
<br>bouncing of mail with an address that no longer exists.
<p>The requests that come in to the address pippin-staff-request are routed
<br>through the majordomo server and returned to the user with instructions
on how
<br>to communicate with the majordomo server.&nbsp; For this address, you
should need
<br>to do nothing but be aware of its existence.&nbsp; This address exists
for
<br>historical reasons mostly.
<p>Any approval requests are forwarded from the majordomo server.&nbsp;
Actions that
<br>change the status of the list are sent by the majordomo server to the
address
<br>pippin-staff-approval.&nbsp; pippin-staff-approval is simply an alias
<br>for the pippin-staff-owner address.
<p>Approval notification is sent for subscriptions, alternate address
<br>subscriptions, and unsubscriptions.&nbsp; If the list is a closed list
(meaning
<br>that no one is added without approval), then the notification is also
a
<br>request for action.&nbsp; As the approval person for the list, you
would need to
<br>send an approval command back to the majordomo server if you approve
of the
<br>person's request.&nbsp; If you don't wish to approve their subscription
you don't
<br>have to do anything, but common courtesy suggests you should send a
note back
<br>to the requestor.
<p>Where to Find Documentation on How Majordomo Works
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
<p>The mailing list services including how to send commands to the
<br>majordomo server at majordomo@lists.stanford.edu is documented
<br>via the world-wide web at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://lists.stanford.edu/
<br>You can also send electronic mail to majordomo@lists.stanford.edu with
<br>the message body of "help" and further information about using the
<br>help system built into majordomo will be e-mailed back to you.
<p>A generic version of this file (with the list specifics in a generic
<br>format) is available via ftp from ftp.stanford.edu at
<br>&nbsp;/pub/mailing-lists/New.List.Owner.Message
<p>Some quick notes about majordomo and your list:
<p>Majordomo operates by taking command lines out of the message text in
a
<br>standard mail message.&nbsp; [NOTE WELL: majordomo will NOT be happy
to receive
<br>NeXTmail!&nbsp; If you use a NeXT system, make sure that you are sending
an ASCII
<br>file.]&nbsp; The subject line is never examined.&nbsp; Multiple commands
should start on
<br>independent lines in the message text.
<p>Your "listname" is pippin-staff and is what should be used for the
<br>majordomo commands.&nbsp; To send mail to the addresses subscribed
to
<br>pippin-staff, send mail to pippin-staff@lists.stanford.edu, the "address"
<br>of the list.
<p>Depending upon the command issued, the majordomo server will either
respond
<br>with information concerning lists or itself, or it will do a subscription
<br>action and tell the user the results.
<p>Issues for Managing A Mailing List With Majordomo
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<p>There are several critical portions to managing a majordomo-controlled
<br>mailing list once the nuts and bolts are in place.&nbsp; Issues highlighted
<br>here are the list password, subscriptions, the list information
<br>file, and the list configuration file.
<p>&nbsp;1. The Password
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------------
<p>There is a separate password set for each majordomo-controlled list.&nbsp;
This
<br>password is need for approval of subscriptions in closed lists, for
changing
<br>the information in the info file sent to users querying about a list,
to
<br>reconfigure the list options, and, of course, to change the password
itself.
<p>To change the password use the command
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passwd &lt;mlist-name> &lt;old-password> &lt;new-password>
<p>For example to change the password for "testlist" from "testing" to
<br>"super-password", issue the following command:
<p>&nbsp;passwd testlist testing super-password
<p>&nbsp;2. Subscription Control
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----------------------
<p>If your list is an open list, then you will get notices of subscription
and
<br>unsubscription actions and majordomo will note that "No action is required
on
<br>your part."&nbsp; If, however, you are in charge of a closed list,
majordomo will
<br>send you notification and ask you to send an APPROVE command to the
majordomo
<br>server (it will even give you the full command except that you'll have
to
<br>replace PASSWORD with your list's password).&nbsp; The syntax for the
approve
<br>command is
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approve &lt;password> {subscribe|unsubscribe} &lt;mlist-name>
&lt;address>
<p>If someone corners you in your office and just asks to be added to the
<br>list, you can send this command right away and not have to wait for
the
<br>subscribe request to be rerouted to you.&nbsp; [There is also an "approve"
<br>Perl script that can be run if you use MH as your mail reader - mail
<br>majordomo-owner@lists for more information.]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;3. List Information File
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ------------------------
<p>There is a pippin-staff.info file maintained by the majordomo server
<br>(based on what you give it, of course) for the purpose of telling
<br>users what the list is all about.&nbsp; Initially this is one line
that
<br>simply says "This information to be supplied by the list owner."&nbsp;
You
<br>should create a replacement file that describes the purpose of your
<br>list and anything you want people to know about it.&nbsp; This is done
with
<br>the newinfo command described below.&nbsp; This file can be requested
by
<br>users at anytime (indeed, even by users not on the list unless it is
a
<br>private list) and is sent to users when they first subscribe.
<p>When you issue the newinfo command to majordomo, it must be the last
<br>command in the message or you must mark the end of your newinfo
<br>message by putting the word "EOF" on a line all by itself after the
<br>last line of the new information note.&nbsp; "EOF" should be at the
<br>beginning of the line.&nbsp; All text after the message is assumed
to be
<br>part of the new info message (yes, even an \"end\" command is
<br>ignored) unless you mark it with EOF.&nbsp; The command syntax is
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newinfo &lt;mlist-name> &lt;password>
<br>&nbsp;&lt;body of new informational text
<br>&nbsp;.
<br>&nbsp;.
<br>&nbsp;that continues until the
<br>&nbsp;.
<br>&nbsp;.
<br>&nbsp;end of your mail or EOF>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;4. List Configuration File
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------------------------
<p>There is a pippin-staff.config file maintained by the majordomo server
<br>for the purpose of controlling posting and presentation options for
<br>the list.&nbsp; Intially, this config file is built based on options
supplied
<br>when the list setup was requested.&nbsp; These options were:
<p>SUBSCRIPTION SETTINGS: closed, any address may attempt
<br>ACCESS SETTINGS: open to the world
<br>ADVERTISING SETTINGS: visible to all addresses world-wide
<br>POSTING SETTINGS: allowed by only addresses subscribed, owner addresses
<p>To change these options, a list owner would use the "config" command
<br>to retrieve a current copy of the configuration file, "newconfig" to
<br>return an editted configuration file as the new list configuration,
<br>and "writeconfig" to make sure that the configuration file lists all
<br>options currently known to the server.
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Other commands that list owners will want to look into are "who" and
<br>"which."&nbsp; In general, be sure to browse over the Web pages at
<br>http://lists.stanford.edu/.
