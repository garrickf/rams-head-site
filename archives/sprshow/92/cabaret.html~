Ram's Head's 1992 production of <cite>Cabaret</cite> featured one of
the most ambitious sets ever built by Ram's Head on the Memorial
Auditorium Stage, designed by <a href="http://www-leland.stanford.edu:80/~phred/">David Andre '94</a>
and <a href="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~smudge/index.html">Lisa
Clark '95</a>. (The two are now engaged to be married!)  It featured two
rotating mini-stages, one of which pivoted out toward the audience; a
twenty-foot-long extendable thrust for the Kit-Kat Club; a structural
catwalk on which followspots were mounted; and four separate
German-impressionist-style drops, with motifs taken from Berlin art of
the 1930's.  <p>

Below is a scene from the &quot;Don't
Tell Mama&quot; number in which the thrust is at half-extension and the
onstage followspots are in use.
