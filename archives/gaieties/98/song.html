<p>It's been six months since we wrote the show<br>
You'll feel like poop if you stay home and don't go<br>
One week since I dropped a class<br>
CS105 was kicking my ass<br>
Three weeks since we found the cast<br>
So much talent, real hard to pick it<br>
Four weeks and the show goes up<br>
You still have two days to buy your block ticket!<br>
<p>
<p>I go to Late Night cuz I want some chicken<br>
They're out of hot wings so I'll be to cheese stickin<br>
Watchin' A Cappella with no lights on<br>
I really hate this song<br>
Cause I'm all about instruments<br>
Like Hoover Tower I'm not flaccid<br>
Weenies on acid<br>
Are always guaranteed to make me laugh<br>
Like Condi Rice I'm making big bank<br>
'Kay I don't make big bank<br>
Cause if id did I'd lose my Pell grant<br>
Flo-mo took their Pro-Fros to the Co-Po for some Fro-Yo<br>
Then they stopped at the Co-Ho -- now you can't do that at Berkeley!<br>
Gonna have to go to see the show it will not blow<br>
It's got the boom Stanford students<br>
It'll make you go berzerkely<br>
<p>
<p>How can I help it if I bash Cal in my sleep<br>
Mean bad stupid hippie weenies make my skin creep<br>
I'm the kind of guy who streaks when Mem Aud is filled<br>
Can't understand what I mean?<br>
Well soon you will!<br>
We have a tendency to make lots of sex jokes<br>
We have a history of taking off our shirts!<br>
