<h2>ACT I</h2>

<b>One Kennell of an Intro</b><p>
<p>
[<i>Picture this: Lights out, crowd going wild for our show.  Before the
orchestra begins to play...  Theme music from Blues Brothers (Peter Gunn theme)
comes on that hydraulic sound system.  Two people dressed as the Blues brothers
approach each other from opposite ends of the stage.  They reach the center and
stop.  Elwood is carrying a briefcase.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Jackie:</b> 	You got it?<p>
<p>
<b>Elwood:</b> 	Yeaaah, I got it.  [<i>Holds up the briefcase.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Jackie:</b> 	Hold on a sec.  [<i>Takes off her left shoe, looks inside,
looks confused, shakes it upside down, looks at Elwood who shakes his head
disappointedly.  Repeat with other shoe.  Key falls onto floor.  Jackie picks
up key and opens briefcase Elwood is holding.  Pulls out document.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Elwood:</b> 	What's it say?<p>
<p>
<b>Jackie:</b> 	[<i>Looking at audience</i>] Branner sucks.  [<i>Lights
out.</i>]<p>
<p>
[<i>Mayhem ensues.  After some semblance of calm, orchestra plays music and the
musical, the real one that is, begins.</i>]<p>
<p>
<p>
BAM! BAM! (OPENER)<p>
<p>
[<i>The lights dim, a hush falls over the partially inebriated audience, and
all of us cross our fingers and hope to God that this is not, truly, goode.
</i>]<p>
[<i>We join a festive bonfire-building scene already in progress </i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:</b> 	Hello everybody, and welcome to the Big Game Bonfire Building
rally.  Although this year's rally will suffer slightly from the fact that
there is no bonfire, we will instead build permanent housing for these
endangered salamanders [<i>motions to a group of people dressed as salamanders
- one of them holds up a sign that says &quot;Suck Our Ass&quot;</i>].  Now, I'd like to
introduce our first speaker.  Since his return to the farm, he has been holed
up in a compound and worshipped by a cult that considers him the messiah.  Here
he is... Coach Bill Walsh. [<i>crowd goes nuts</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Walsh:</b> 	Beloved Stanford fans.   Two days from now, we go up against the
Bears.  The team they have this year is one of the toughest ever to come out of
Chicago, even without Coach Ditka.  Now I know some of you have been worried
that we're going into this without Joe [<i>crowd looks kind of confused</i>].
But we've been practicing hard all week, and I can promise you that we're
ready, and we're gonna keep the Axe where it belongs...with the 49ers. [<i>mild
applause</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:</b>  	Okay, thank you Coach. Heh, heh.   It's now my pleasure to
announce that everyone working at the rally tonight will be provided with a
<u>free barbeque</u>!<p>
<p>
<b>Crowd:</b>	Yea!!<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:</b>	Brought to you by our friends at... University Food Service!<p>
<p>
<b>Crowd:</b>	Boo!!<p>
<p>
<b>One guy:</b>	Yeah!!  [<i>He looks around self consciously.  You know the
drill.</i>]<p>
<p>
[<i>Hashers emerge carrying trays of food.  Spotlight up on David, a hasher,
serving food to Crowdpersons 1 &amp; 2.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Crowdperson1:</b>  What's wrong there, little hasher?  You look so
forlorn.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	I don't mean to spoil your evening.  It's just that I have a bad
feeling about this year's Big Game.  That Stanford might lose the Axe
somehow.<p>
<p>
<b>Crowdperson2:</b> What are you talking about, dude?  Cal hasn't had the Axe
since the Reagan years.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	It's just that --<p>
<p>
<b>Crowdperson3:</b>  You <u>would</u> worry about losing to Cal.  It's so...
'80's.<p>
<p>
<b>Crowdperson 1:</b>  Yeah.  Name one good thing that has come to an end
lately.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	<u>Cheers</u>, Michael Jordan's career, the childish idealism of
the Clinton White House --<p>
<p>
<b>Crowdperson 2:</b>  Alright alright.  You may be right.<p>
<p>
[<i>Lights up on a cheezy lounge singer in the juliet.  She is dressed in very
tacky clothing and has no bearing on the show whatsoever.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Lounge Singer:</b>  You may be right!  I may be crazy, ho! but it just may
be a loo-natic you're lookin' for!<p>
<p>
[<i>Everyone does a take at the juliet and then proceeds.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>David:	</b>Optimism can be dangerous.  I remember when I first arrived at
Stanford with my parents...<p>
<p>
[<i>Flashback music.  Two corny-lookin' parents and Young David, (who looks
nothing like the old one, but has on a hasher outfit) enter stage left!</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Father:</b>	You'll have a great time here, son.  Look at that beautiful
church and quad-like structure.<p>
<p>
<b>Mother:</b>	Looks like there's a lot of nice girls for you to date.<p>
<p>
<b>Father:</b>	And you'll drink lots of beer on weekends and never do any
homework, and there'll be a cushy job waiting for you when you get out.<p>
<p>
<b>Young David:</b>  I don't know.  I've just got this feeling that something
bad's gonna happen.<p>
<p>
<b>Father &amp; Mother:</b>  Don't worry!!  What could go wrong? [<i>honking
noise</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Young David:</b>  Mom, Dad, look out for the Marguerite!!  [<i>Parents
scream and brace themselves, lights go down on flashback</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b> 	[<i>back in the present</i>]  That was the worst day of my life.
 Since then I could never believe that wonderful perfect things could happen to
a guy like me. <p>
<p>
[<i>A guy who has been listening in wretches at the intense cheeziness of
David's story.  Spotlight back on the emcee</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:	</b>And now, the main event: the introduction of the student who has
been specially chosen by the Axe Comm, Dean Montoya, and you, the voters, to
guard the Axe until Saturday's Big Game when we crush Cal and kill 'em and
stomp 'em and-- [<i>he breaks out into vicious barking, then regains
control</i>].  Excuse me.  This Keeper of the Axe has impeccable credentials:
two-time intramural football champion, Hum Bio TA as a sophomore, and volunteer
firefighter.  In fact, it makes me wonder what all you lazy assholes have been
doing with <u>your</u> time.  Ladies, gentlemen, and members of the academy,
give it up for Nitro &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Cagney!<p>
<p>
[<i>Hulking American Gladiator type woman emerges to claim the Axe, as crowd
cheers wildly</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>[SONG 1:  &quot;We Need a Hero!&quot;]</b><p>
<blockquote>
<b>Nitro:</b>	Stanford's under Berkeley's attacks<br>
	You're scared we won't hold onto the Axe<br>
	Big Game anxiety<br>
	You need a hero!<br>
	And that's me!<br>
<p>
<b>Everyone:</b>	Post Office lines are getting longer<br>
	The Clocktower's time keeps getting wronger<br>
	Our mascot is a tree<br>
	We need a hero!<br>
<b>Nitro:</b>	And that's me!<br>
<p>
<b>Everyone:</b>	We need a little magic to save us some face<br>
	We need a little magic to put Oski in his place!<br>
<p>
<b>Everyone:</b>	Stanford's sinking into ruts<br>
	of apathy and budget cuts<br>
<b>	</b>Stanford needs a hero<br>
<b>Nitro:</b>	And that hero is me!<b></b><br>
</blockquote>
[<i>Music stops as suddenly, out of </i><cite>no</cite><i>where, three Cal
Terrorists jump onto the platform, wearing blue and gold terrorist gear.  They
all have guns (or maybe just high-end supersoakers) and the leader has his gun
at Nitro's neck.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Terrorist 1:</b>	Okay, everybody calm down!  Nobody moves or Supergirl here
gets it!<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:</b>	What do you want??<p>
<p>
<b>Terrorist 2:</b>	We are ruthless, diabolical terrorists from Cal, and we
have only three demands: one million in cash [<i>a gasp from the crowd</i>]
the Axe [<i>everyone gasps</i>] and six tickets to your Vienese Ball!
[<i>general mayhem a la </i><cite>Airplane</cite><i>.</i>  <i>Terrorist 1 tries
to regain some control</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Terrorist 1:	</b>Okay, maybe just the Axe.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	Hold it right there!  [<i>David has grabbed Terrorist 3 from
behind</i>]  Drop your weapons, or I force feed your friend here with this
oatburger!!  [<i>He pulls an oatburger from his hashing apron, waving it
menacingly at the crowd</i>]<p>
<p>
[<i>There is a moment of tension</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Terrorist 1:</b>	Okay man.  Don't do anything rash now.  We'll just put...
down... the guns.<p>
<p>
[<i>David stuffs the oatburger down Terrorist 3's throat, causing him to start
shhoting uncontrollably.  Terrorist 3 kills Terrorists 1 and 2, Nitro, all the
salamanders, and , with a final shot, someone who has been planted in the
audience.  The audience member keels over, and is dragged off by two
stagehands.  Terrorist 3 then keels over, choking on the oatburger.  The crowd
cheers.  David stands dazed.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:</b>	What's your name, son?<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	David Hasseldorf.<p>
<p>
<b>Emcee:</b>	David, you've saved the Axe!  Since Nitro is now dead, <u>you</u>
are its rightful keeper!  Stanford's prized possession is now in your hands!
[<i>Crowd sings again as the Axe is chained to David's wrist.</i>]<p>
<p>
[<b>Song 1, continued</b>]<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Everyone:	</b>Stanford's dying for some leadership<b></b><br>
<b>	</b>We're more misguided than the readership<b></b><br>
<b>	</b>Of the Stanford Review<br>
	We need a hero!<br>
	And that's you!<br>
<p>
	Give us Herculean deeds<br>
	All the while keeping in mind our diverse yet equally valid and pressing multicultural needs<br>
	It's not so hard to do<br>
	We need a hero!<br>
	And that's you!<br>
<p>
<b>Everyone:</b>	We need someone to put the twinkle back in Stanford's eye<br>
	We need someone who'll guard the Axe even if he has to die!<br>
<p>
	We want to be the best and we<br>
	Just need a little destiny<br>
	A guy with truckloads of virtu<br>
	We need a hero!<br>
	And that's you!<br>
<p>
	Stanford needs a hero<br>
	And that hero is you!<br>
</blockquote>
[<i>David, at the center of the dancing chorus, faints at the end of the song
from all the pressure.  As people try to revive him, spotlight comes up on
Stacy and Evil Cal Boss, stage left.  Maybe a little ominous music.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Boss:	</b>Damn that pesky hasher!  Tell me, Agent 99.  Why do we weenies
only get screwed when we're not trying?<p>
<p>
<b>Stacy:</b>	We can't give up, Boss.  I've been at Cal four years and this is
the first time I've been this close to the Axe.  I'm so close I can smell it.
I'm so close I can hear it.  I'm--<p>
<p>
<b>Boss:</b>	Alright, Stacy, I get it.  We've got to think of a way to steal
that Axe from those Stanford punks.<p>
<p>
<b>Stacy:	</b>Put me on the case, Boss.  No more terrorists and guns.  I can
use more subtle ways to get to this <i>David</i>.  I just need to get close
enough to, to-<p>
<p>
<b>Boss:</b>	Grab his Axe?<p>
<p>
<b>Stacy:</b>	Yes.  <p>
<p>
<b>Boss:	</b>Alright, Stacy.  Give it a shot.  But you'd better put on this
super-stealth disguise [<i>He hands her a bunch of Stanford clothing</i>]
Don't spill anything on that sweatshirt.  It cost me $79.95 at the Bookstore.
Report to me by phone in twenty-four hours.  [<i>He exits</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Stacy: 	</b>[<i>Looking over at David</i>]  David, your Axe is mine.
[<i>She slips into the shadows</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	[<i>Coming to</i>]  What happened?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	You just passed out.  But you're okay.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	Are you a doctor?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	I'm pre-med, which is practically as good.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	[<i>Taking her hands tenderly</i>]  It's good enough for me.<p>
<p>
[<i>Appropriate </i><cite>West Side Story</cite><i> music comes up.</i>]<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	My hands are cold.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	Pardon?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	I said I live in Hammerskjøld. <p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	I live in Haus Mitt!  [<i>Their eyes light up - they have a
Germanic moment</i>]  Weisst du, wie kann ich der Hauptbahnhof finden?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	Natürlich, es ist neben des Hauses von der Grossen Hund.
[<i>They laugh knowingly</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>David:	</b>[<i>Bubbly</i>]  What's your name?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	Rebecca.  Becca.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>	Rebeccabecca.  That's pretty.  Can I walk you home?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	[<i>taking his arm</i>]  I think this is the beginning of a
beautiful relationship! [<i>David and Becca exit</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Stacy:</b>	We'll see about that!  BWUH, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!<p>
<p>
[<i>End of this particular scene.</i><b>] </b><p>
<b>Crossing the Line</b><p>
<p>
[<i>In front of red.  David and Becca on the way to her dorm.  There is a bush
with legs on one side of the stage, behind which hides N.R.A.  Those are his
legs.  Throughout the following dialogue he sneaks closer to David and Becca,
occasionally picking up the bush and getting closer to them.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>  	Oh Becca, your eyes remind me of Lake Lag in Spring: brown and
teeming with life.<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>  	Your hair is as shiny and silky as a scarf!<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>  	If I could have all the characters of 90210 over for a
barbecue, or I could have you, I would totally pick you.<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b> 	Me too.  But David, we don't have to try to impress each other
like this.   We already <i>have</i> each other!<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>  	Wow.  Well then--can I kiss you?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>  	It's so nice to have someone who asks.  My old boyfriend always
tried to order me around.  Let's mash.  <p>
<p>
[<i>They mash.  N.R.A. leaps out, still in bush suit</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	DETACH FACE!  [<i>N.R.A. baffles David with a bunch of
impressive judo moves, then puts him in a headlock.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b> 	Becca!  I'm being attacked by a bush!<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	I'm not a bush, fool, I'm you're worst nightmare.  [<i>Holds
up his hand in front of David's face, with the other hand over his mouth</i>]
You see this, boy?  You're staring down the barrel of a first issue hand unit,
a human weapon, a fine-tuned fightin' marine machine.  Attention!  Apology
demanded!  [<i>David has been trying to get N.R.A.'s hand off his mouth, doing
petty torture, and then . . </i>] I can stand your petty torture, even if you
lick my hand!  [<i>He screams</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b> 	[<i>Who had been temporarily frozen in an &quot;I'm being kissed&quot;
position, with a dreamy look on her face, snaps to attention</i>]  Marine!  Ten
HUT!  Cease torture on civilian!<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	[<i>Totally whipped but still passionate</i>]  Okay.  Sorry,
Becca, but this wimpy little piece of...  [<i>Becca points at him
menacingly</i>]  I mean, sorry, I am really very sorry...<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>  	[<i>gasping for air</i>]  You <i>know</i> this lunatic?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca: </b> 	He's the ex-boyfriend I was telling you about.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b> 	You dated a bush?  It must have hurt when you...<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b> 	Cease discussion of my after-hours ability!  After all, you
were just licking a man's hand . . . [<i>wipes his hand on his fatigues</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>  	Okay, let's all take a minute for an anti-testosterone
exercise.  Imagine cherry fro yo, soothing, cooling us down... [<i>N.R.A.
breathes deeply, David's baffled</i>]  Now. David, this is Raymond.  Raymond,
David.<p>
<p>
<b>David:</b>  	How funny is that?  Your last name is my first name.<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>	My old name is Raymond.  I now demand to be called the New
Residential Authority.  That's N.R.A. for short.<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>  	[<i>To David, explaining</i>] Raymond just became an R.A. in
Donner [<i>or frosh dorm with block tickets.</i>]  The real RA... disappeared,
so he took over.  Raymond.  You have to quit following me around.  We broke up
three years ago.  Three, trois, tres, get it?<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	Living without you takes a lot of getting used to.  I should
learn to live with it, but I don't want to.  [<i>pause, as we let this
sentiment sink in.</i>]  Look, let me make it up to you two. At exactly 1900
hours I will be putting on that award winning program, Crossing the Line.  I've
made a few changes...why don't you come as my VIPs?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b> 	Well . . . maybe just to make peace.<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	That's the spirit, private.  [<i>turns to David</i>] Maybe
you'll learn something, boy. <p>
<p>
[<i>Curtains open to reveal a freshman dorm lounge, complete with Res Ed
furniture and a bunch of happy frosh.  Down the middle of the lounge is a big
white line--maybe up the back wall too so that the audience can see it.  Some
little vamp in high heels starts playing the background - not too loud now.  On
the other side, N.R.A. is decked out in full paramilitary gear, possibly
carrying a high-powered weapon. </i>]<p>
<p>
<b>Little frosh #1:</b> [<i>stage left along with many of his/her fellow
frosh</i>]  Hey, are you going to the dorm program?<p>
<p>
<b>Little frosh #2:</b>  I don't know.  I've got a lot of CIV reading.  You
know, CIV <u>is </u>a five unit class.  Are you going?<p>
<p>
<b>LF #1:</b>  	I've heard this program is really awesome and it allows us to
look more sensitive than we really are.  But I think N.R.A. made a few
changes.<p>
<p>
<b>LF #2:</b>  	N.R.A.  Name kind of fits, huh?<p>
<p>
<b>LF #1:</b>  	You said it brother [<i>Makes that pointing gesture like Isaac
on Love Boat</i>]  C'mon, let's check it out.  [<i>They walk over and join
their brethren/sisteren</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b> 	[<i>blows whistle, frosh come to attention</i>]  All right, all
you overly sensitive, Snapple drinking, Simpsons-watching, aerobicizing,
CIV-readin' little runts!  I understand you enjoyed last week's program, the
lecture by Phil Zimbardo.<p>
<p>
[<i>Frosh snap into zombie-like trance, hands in front of them.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>All Frosh:</b>	Yes master.  Zimbardo is our king and we are sworn to do his
bidding.  [<i>They all return to normal</i>}<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A:</b>	Very good.  This week's program is Crossing the Line.  Let me
explain the rules:  [<i>Reads from piece of paper</i>]  Line up behind this
piece of tape.  [<i>frosh waffle</i>]  I'm talking to <u>you</u>!  [<i>they
fall into line</i>]  That's better.  Now, I'll be making some statements here,
and if one applies to you, you cross the line.  If it doesn't apply, you don't
cross it.  [<i>in a mocking tone</i>]  Everything is confidential and we will
all accept each other.  [<i>spits on paper and throws it down</i>]  Any
questions?<p>
<p>
<b>Freshman #12:</b>  Yeah, um, I have to go to my CIV section at 7, so do you
think it'd be possible for me to leave--<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:	</b>[<i>snaps back</i>]  No!  Drop and give me ten, and get back in
line!  Don't you see what I'm trying to do here?  We're trying to build a
community, a cohesive unit, a relentlessly efficient killing machine!  We're
going to...[<i>disgusted</i>] bond, and then we're going to go out there and
kick some Branner ass!  And if any of you fuck up, I'll sick Schwartzkopf on
you!  [<i>indicates Schwartzie, his dog, who very well may be played by a
person</i>]  Let the exercise begin!<p>
<p>
<b>[SONG 2: &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;]</b><p>
<blockquote>
<b>N.R.A.: 	</b>Here's an offering new for the dorm.<br>
<b>Chorus:</b>  	It's crossing the line, it's crossing the line.<br>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	I'm here to make sure you don't stray from the norm.<br>
<b>Chorus:</b>  	It's crossing the line, it's crossing the line.<br>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	They said that I'd never work for Res Ed<br>
<b>Chorus:</b>  	It's crossing the line, it's crossing the line.<br>
<b>N.R.A.: </b> 	And now they're all suspiciously dead.<br>
<b>Chorus:</b>  	It's crossing the line, it's crossing the line.<br>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	An R.A. they said I never could be<br>
<b>Chorus:</b>  	It's crossing the line, it's crossing the line.<br>
<b>N.R.A.: </b> 	Soon all of Res Ed will answer to ME!<br>
<b>Chorus:</b>  	It's crossing the line, it's crossing the line.<br>
</blockquote>
[<i>Return to dialogue, although music continues softly in the
background.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	All right, let's begin.  First statement:  `Anyone who cried
at the end of &quot;Sleepless in Seattle,&quot; CROSS THE LINE!  [<i>7-8 women and 1 man
hesitatingly cross the line.  N.R.A. gets in the guy's face</i>]  <p>
<blockquote>
	You sissy boy<br>
	Get out of the room!<br>
	Put on a dress<br>
	And wear some perfume! [<i>shouts</i>]  Out!  Out!<br>
</blockquote>
[<i>Pause, while guy leaves stage</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	OK, next statement.  Anyone who has been to a fraternity party
in the past two weeks, CROSS THE LINE!<p>
<p>
[<i>Freshmen hesitate, looking at each other, and when one finally starts to
cross, all the others stampede forward, except for one girl.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	YOU!  What kind of a woman are you? [<i>sings</i>]<p>
<blockquote>
	You study long<br>
	And avoid the crowd<br>
	Your uptight ways<br>
	Would make Sappho proud!  OUT!  OUT! <br>
</blockquote>
[<i>She runs off stage, weeping.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>  	All right, next statement.  Anyone who has ever had a pet,
CROSS THE LINE!<p>
<p>
[<i>Paranoid freshmen cross and uncross the line several times, looking to
N.R.A. for some kind of response.  Finally they all settle across the
line.</i>]<p>
<p>
<b>N.R.A.: </b> 	All right.  It's a good thing, when you're growing up, to have
a pet.  [<i>Cumulative sigh of relief, wiping of brows, etc.</i>]  <p>
<p>
[<i>Frosh-Chorus starts machine-like dance while N.R.A. sings, and
indiscriminately shoots down frosh one after another as David and Becca watch
in abject horror.</i>]<p>
<blockquote>
<b>N.R.A.:</b>	Cross the Line if you've got the guts<br>
		Do that non-conformist deal<br>
		Then I'll shoot your ass - I'll kick your nuts<br>
		And we'll see just how brave you feel!<br>
		[<i>next stanza sung at David - he's still picking off frosh</i>]<br>

<p>
<b>Boss:	</b>Very well Stacy.  I'm a bit concerned, so don't be surprised if I
send in some back-up to secure our objective.  This Becca is a threat to our
mission.   Proceed with caution and remember - the students of Cal are counting
on you, and they can't count much past 100, so you've got to move quickly.<p>

have a little fun if you're in the mood.  He's also chained to an Axe-shaped

<b>Montoya: 	</b>So you see, David couldn't have been the murderer. If he was
the killing kind he would <i>never</i> have made it through the arduous process
of elimination to attend this fine institution.<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:	</b>If being a Stanford student is so great, then how come that Stacy
Campanille got hacked to bits with Stanford's Axe?<p>
<p>
<b>Montoya:</b>	Stacy Campanille?  I don't remember any Stacy Campanille at
Stanford.  What year was she?<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	Senior, I think.  She seemed very... mature.<p>
<p>
<b>Montoya:</b>	No, we only have 48 Stacy's - one from every state except
Alaska and Vermont.  Now we have a guy named Stucco from Vermont, did very well
on the verbal -<p>
<p>
<b>Becca:</b>	Dean Montoya, that's really interesting, but what you're saying
is Stacy's not a student here.  That's like... Julia Roberts marrying Lyle
Lovett - it just <u>doesn't</u> <u>make</u> <u>sense</u>!<p>

<a name="version-info">Version Info</a><p>

With the exception of a scene ending, this is exactly the script that was
performed onstage.

<p>

The ending to the Stresser's scene was revised to give at least some semblance
of a rationale for the tree chorus in a subsequent scene.  I also threw in
a joke about US News and World Report.
