The plot of Gaieties, although different every year, usually involves making fun of our
arch-rivals across the Bay, the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California
at Berkeley</a>, also known as CAL. Cal students are also known as Weenies. In the opening
of <cite>The Last Axe Hero</cite>, shown above, three confused Cal Terrorists (Lori
Ginsburg '95, John &quot;Flippy&quot; Lucero '95, and Vance Vanier '95) sporting
waterguns, swimming goggles, and bright blue and gold leotards attack Stanford Axe-Keeper
Nitro (Atim Udoffia '95) at the annual bonfire-building rally and begin making
unreasonable demands. Although Cal narrowly edged out Stanford in the subsequent <a
href="http://www-leland.stanford.edu:80/group/axecomm/handbook/history.html">Big Game</a>,
the none-too-bright Cal Terrorists returned in the opening of the following Gaieties,
unaware that the <a
href="http://www-leland.stanford.edu:80/group/axecomm/handbook/blade.html">Axe</a> was
already at Berkeley.</p>

<p>In the photograph to the right, Sexy Cal villainess Stacy <a

(<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~khleyr/">Kristen Meinhold '95</a>) seduces new
Axe-Keeper David Hasseldorf (Brennan Carlson '96).</p>

<p>Much to Kristen's dismay, this photograph has graced the pages of just about every
Stanford Daily article about Ram's Head since it was taken. And now it graces our web
pages too! (Don't kill me Kristen, Adrian wanted me to put it here! I mean, it is pretty
good publicity, you have to admit.)</p>

<p>Since Stanford is on the quarter system, there are usually only five weeks of classes
in the fall before the Big Game. Although the script and most of the music for Big Game
Gaieties is completed over the previous summer, that still leaves only one week for
publicity and auditions and five weeks of rehearsals for a full-length original musical
production.</p>

<p>Still, the energy and enthusiasm of the cast and crew somehow always brings it together
in time, even if it means rehearsing in parking lots, &quot;borrowing&quot; props from
public places, or wearing less clothing on stage than one is truly comfortable with.</p>
