  <font color="bb0000"><b><p>Jennie Caleshu (Producer)</b></font> - With a giant sucking
  sound in the spring of 1996, Ram's Head snatched me out of hum bio hell and threw me into
  TD-ing a little special project called Loot. Like the drug pushers they are, they gave me
  a free taste of crack just to get me addicted, enough to make me stage manage Gaieties
  1996 to support my habit. With that under my belt, I spent winter quarter whoring myself
  to companies to support City of Angels and spring break fighting with Pagemaker and
  Photoshop to make the program. Fool's Dream quickly followed (no rest for the foolish!)
  and my production career (I think...I'll get back to you...) truly began. Now I'm
  producing this mother. And despite Jit's best efforts to convince all male cast members to
  the contrary, my title as sketch queen is now relinquished (grin). </p>
  <p><font color="bb0000"><b>Jennifer Gadda (Assistant Producer, Block Tickets)</b></font> -
  Jen Gadda (commonly known as &quot;Jengadda&quot;) is an Assistant Producer, managing
  ticket sales and block ticket seating, as well as building bizzare sets at Quinn's will,
  and generally hanging around backstage. She's a sophomore currently in search of a major,
  and lives for the hope that one day, RENT will come to San Francisco. </p>
  <p><font color="bb0000"><b>Jase Hernandez (House Manger, Costume Designer)</b></font> -
  Welcome to the sketchiest, yet most rewarding experience of your Stanford careers. I am
  Jase and I am your costume designer and house manager; a gaieties veteran, i know well the
  how crazy the next weeks will be, but the people will make it very worthwhile. If you have
  any questions/ issues about Gaieties, Rams Head, the meaning of life, ANYTHING! please
  give me a call i would love to listen to your fears, alleviate your stress, recount
  sketchiness of days past. my number is 7-5125! </p>
  <p><font color="bb0000"><b>Kevin Lemmons (Social Manger)</b></font> - I am Kevin Lemons,
  your happening social manager, and I love you. My dearly important job includes getting to
  know the cast, ensuring that everyone is enjoying themselves, giving lap dances to the
  staff, and organizing the not to be missed, once in a lifetime, 100th anniversary, highly
  scandalous GAIETIES RETREAT, destined to be one of the highlights of your Stanford
  experience. Everyone must go! </p>
  <p><font color="bb0000"><b>Hillary Stamm (Business Manager)</b></font> - Hi, I am Hillary
  and I have lots of money -- Gaieties money, that is, 'cause I am the business manager....
  I wish I could be up on stage too but Holly won't let me... I's a senior... from Seattle. </p>
  <p><font color="bb0000"><b>Christina Drake (Assistant Producer, Program and Spring Show
  '98 Producer)</b></font> - This fall I'll be hitting up businesses for money and you guys
  to work on Spring Show. I'll also be getting friendly with Pagemaker. This cross-over to
  the darkside (I'm a drama major and that's what it's considered) began with some crack and
  Stage Managing last year's Spring Show - City of Angels/Angles/Furniture. Moving on to
  Jello shots and Goldschlager, I auditioned for Fool's Dream and then somehow wound up also
  doing props (I can make a butterfly net out of some wire, white gauze and a stick). And,
  oh yeah, the Stanford Men's Basketball Team is dreamy. BEAT CAL! </p>

  <p><font color="007700"><b>Holly Crafts (Director)</b></font> - well, i've been entirely
  too involved in ram's head, probably for my own and the health of others around me. and
  even more so for this gaieties thing--you can also call me sybil in terms of my
  responsibilities: first a writer, then director, then board member. in my free time i
  kitchen manage at my house, kairos, and am working on my honors thesis. i'm feeling like i
  have a little time to spare so maybe i'll take up badminton. i wish to thank my cat, bob,
  for being a tolerant and loving support, and to my mom, for all the kegstands to come. and
  also, to mike, for the full monty. </p>
  <p><font color="007700"><b>Nathan Baynard (Assistant Director)</b></font> - is a
  19-year-old sophomore from the Washington DC area. He has been performing for a long time,
  but his life was not complete until he was in Gaieties last year. Playing the guy in the
  Spandex shirt/surfer dude/Hick was one of the best memories of his life. He continued
  performing throughout the year with City of Angels and Falsettos, but is very excited to
  be back with Gaeities this year and can't wait for his first stint behind the scenes in a
  directing capacity. </p>
  <p><font color="007700"><b>Jo Chien (Choreographer)</b></font> - My name is Jo Chien and I
  am the choreographer for Gaieties this year. For three nights, I will make you, or at
  least make you appear to be, a hip, groovin', sexy Dancin' Diva or Divo. You will be the
  object of everyone's desire and envy as you thrust that pelvis and roll that hip. You will
  grow to love your body. You will love to touch your body, and you will love to have your
  body touched by both friends and strangers alike. Get ready to do some serious sweatin'! </p>
  <p><font color="007700"><b>Jenna Land (Assistant Choreographer)</b></font> - I started
  Stanford with Ram's Head my freshman year, and haven't gotten it out of my system. After a
  brief stint playing memorable characters such as Jan Brady and &quot;Brigitta&quot; in The
  Axe Files, I took the rest of the year off. But I came back in my sophomore year to play
  the &quot;good&quot; whore in City Of Angels. I love to dance, I can't sing, and I think
  Barry Manilow is the best musician in the world. </p>
  <p><font color="007700"><b>Chris Tate (Vocal Director)</b></font> - In the early 1800's a
  noble English gentleman and his beautiful -- but fragile -- wife bore a set of twins. Due
  to mysterious circumstances, one of the twins was lost. Raised by a family of unusually
  large squirrels, the boy learned the ways of the forest... including, but not limited to,
  cracking nuts with only his left front tooth. That man eventually found his way to
  America, where he started a family. This man had a son, who also had a son, who... has
  absolutely no relation to me. I was born in New Jersey. I'm the vocal director. Thank You.
  </p>
  <p><font color="007700"><b>Will Buck (Music Director)</b></font> - Will Buck is a
  sophomore majoring in music. In addition to conducting, he plays the trumpet, and in his
  free time, re-lives his high school cross-country glory days by jogging a mile or two. </p>
  <p><font color="007700"><b>Christiaan Royer (Composer)</b></font> - Hi! I am a easy-going
  CSE and MST major who enjoys good conversation, good food, and good music. Speaking of
  good music, as composer, I want to make sure the score is well-polished and can get the
  audience involved. If you have any questions/comments about the music, feel free to get in
  touch with me. Enjoy the 100th Big Game Gaieties! </p>

  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Quinn McKew (Technical Director)</b></font> - hey all, i'm
  quinn mckew, the older member of the mckew squared technical team and the technical
  director for gaieties this year. i'm also on the board of directors for ram's head, so i
  get to tell myself no when i want to spend more money. i've been such a tool for ram's
  head over the past three years that there's a spot for a drill bit in my head, so if you
  have any questions about almost anything feel free to ask. </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Andy Roberts (Assistant Technical Director)</b></font> - I
  guess I need to think of something funny to say for my bio. Is it like City, where we each
  get a sentence, or now that I'm staff I get like a whole page? I hazard to guess that I
  only get a sentence, but that's okay. I'll think of something funny. Let's see, I'm still
  &quot;waiting for someone to pull my finger&quot; but I did that one for city. Is the joke
  old? Hmmm. How about, &quot;is sick of people pulling his finger and wants something else
  pulled?&quot; No, too subtle. How about something for DKE? Okay okay, let me think here.
  How about, wait I've got it. How about: &quot;Can't live with 'em. Pass the
  beernuts.&quot; -- Norm from Cheers </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Molly &quot;Wanker&quot; McKew &amp; Matt &quot;Moron-san&quot;
  Traverso (Co set designers)</b></font> - Notice the title. Neither of us is an ASSistant
  anything. Well, we try not to advertise, at least. We are only moderately insane. We
  create based on the visions given to us by the golden master. Our credo: &quot;My head is
  on loose, but my shoes are tight. This makes interpretive dance difficult, and altogether
  challenging. Major in something techie or find yourself the center of attention at every
  cocktail party.&quot; </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>John Knag (Lighting Designer)</b></font> - John is the lighting
  designer for Gaieties 97. He was very excited about designing a show on the big stage...
  till he found out he had a day to do it. While not living in Mem Aud, John expresses his
  joy de vivre in many ways, including sailing, consuming &quot;shlager&quot; and
  representing the old skool. </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Elizabeth Martin (Sound Designer)</b></font> - Elizabeth Martin
  is a sophomore who has never been involved with a Ram's Head Production before. She is a
  drama nut who has done just about every job in the theatre EXCEPT sound and is looking
  forward to giving that a try. She is also hoping to declare drama this quarter. </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Sheela Hedge (Sound Designer)</b></font> - Hi. I'm Sheela. I
  was told to design sound. I tried to get it to go faster, like around the speed of light,
  and I tried to give it color, but it didn't work. Oh well. If you can at least hear them
  singing on stage, my job is done. </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Wrenn Levenberg (Props Mistress)</b></font> - I'm Wrenn
  Levenberg, a junior living in Lambda Nu. Last year, I went to Gaieties and came out of the
  theatre with sore stomach and cheek muscles from laughing so much. I am from Chicago, I
  love Colorado, and I have never been involved in a production before. This fall, I am
  Props Queen and looking forward to having tons of fun with all the new people I meet. One
  more sentence: I like to laugh and eat and dance and sleep and play Ultimate Frisbee and
  go to the beach and email and watch movies and read and drink smoothies. </p>
  <p><font color="0000bb"><b>Kim Harrison (Costume Designer)</b></font> - no sense of humor,
  no sense of style, no sense at all. nevertheless, they decided to give me a chance. my
  gratitude to the gaieties folk. special thanks to nc and the suite posse. and of course,
  to my incredible edible pie. oh, and the violator lives on... </p>
