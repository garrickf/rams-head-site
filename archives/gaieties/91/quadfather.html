The highlight of Gaieties '91 for many audience members was the final
Gaieties cameo of then-president Donald Kennedy.  The scene: Tony and
Maria, two Stanford students, are being married by the Pope in front
of Stanford's Memorial Church.  Their wedding is interrupted by two
men, both claiming to be Maria's long-lost Uncle Vito visiting from
Sicily.  Who can tell which is the real Don Vito?  After all, says the
Pope, &quot;They are both so convincing!&quot; <p>

President Kennedy then enters as &quot;Don
Don,&quot; and feigns a heart attack.  When one of the Vitos suggests
taking him to the Cowell Student Health Center, Don Don instantly
recovers, noting that &quot;only a Weenie would suggest taking a dying man
to Cowell!&quot;  The impostor, Domino, is taken away in cuffs (handcuffs,
you idiot), and a jubilant dance number ensues (The <cite>Stanford
Lambada</cite>). <p>

At the height of the number, the dance captain flings off her hat,
revealing herself as none other than Robin Kennedy, Stanford's First
Lady.  &quot;Wanna dance?&quot; she asks Don coyly, and the scene ends as Don
and Robin tango solo in the spotlight.<p>

Below, Don Don falls ill, attended to by (from left to right) Vito
(José Paco Farias '94), the parents of the bride (Guy Tucker
'92 and Elena Melendez '94), the happy couple (Dylana Blum '95 and
Steve Sherman '95), and impostor Domino (Tony Farrell '94, '95).
