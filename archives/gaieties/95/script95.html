<h3>Scene I:	THE MAUSOLEUM HOOTENANNY</h3>
<p>
<b>(A wamma bamma opener with intro)</b>
<p>

<i>[Overture ends and the theater goes dark. I mean really, really dark.
An eerie music begins to play, perhaps the very same eerie music that open
that "The X Files" show everyone seems to like so much. Eerie lights flash
as well.]</i>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD DOING AN EERIE NON-HICKISH VOICE OVER:</b>   University denies
knowledge. Administration cover-up. Unexplained phenomenae. The mysterious
return of the `F'. An enforced alcohol policy. Admission fees for sporting
events. The Casa de Fruta cup flipper. What other things have we missed?
What other mysteries are there? A certain four Stanford affiliates will soon
find out all too much. <i>[A spotlight opens on each of them, one at a time.
*KaNdeE* wears her dollie suit and a Peruvian tin miner hat; Jeremy is in a
flannel and torn jeans; Myra, our idealistic wide-eyed frosh and Professor
Hobart share a horse costume, though are now separated. They are all that is
visible on stage.]</i> Enter *KaNdeE*, <i>[Okay.]</i> an Anthro major from
Pocatello, Idaho -- also a ninja-dollie. Myra Dinkelspiel, an idealistic
freshman, undeclared. Professor Don Hobart, your frosh dorm RF. And Jeremy,
who really wishes he was from Seattle. Yes, for Stanford's sake we pray they
will have the strength. The strength to uncover the mysteries of...
THE AXE FILES. THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE... Really.... Honest... I swear to god.
<p>
<i>[Curtain opens and we find our favorite four already positioned in what
appears to be a very hip looking Mausoleum party. Speakers blare `Angel is a
Centerfold.' Many people are dancing, drinking and enjoying themselves.
<p>
Clever costumes abound: such as Hoover tower, devils, witches, India, the
Tree, a human liver, an uncooperative wheel of brie, the Dish, a box of
cereal, a ghost, monkey and Death (you can't see his face, what with the
hood and all), et cetera.]</i>
<p>
Song One:  <b>ON LELAND AND LELAND AND JANE!</b>
<p>
(OR <b>AT THE MAUSOLEUM!, WHITE BOY'S VERSION</b>)
<p>
MAN, CAN WE THROW A PARTY?!<br>
WITH GHOSTS AND GHOULS AND DRESSED-UP FOOLS WHO DRANK TOO MUCH 	BACARDI!<br>
CAUTION HAS BEEN THROWN TO THE WIND<br>
WHO KNOWS WHERE WE'RE GOIN'<br>
AND WHO CARES WHERE WE'VE BEEN?
<p>
WE PUT AWAY THE PENCILS AND WE THREW AWAY THE BOOKS<br>
FORGET ABOUT THE TEACHERS AND BRING ON THOSE DIRTY LOOKS<br>
WHO NEEDS ISOMERS AND POLYMERS AND POLYSORBATE CHAINS?<br>
LET'S GO DANCING! <br>
ON LELAND AND LELAND AND JANE!
<p>
WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR CELEBRATION?<br>
THESE THREE CORPSES HAVEN'T ROCK N' ROLLED FOR GENERATIONS<br>
HEY, TIME FOR CARPE DIEM<br>
END THAT NOOKIE DROUGHT TONIGHT AT THE MAUSOLEUM
<p>
IN CAMBRIDGE THEY'RE STILL STUDYIN', IN PRINCETON THEY'RE BEHAVIN'<br>
THEY'RE LOCKED INSIDE THOSE IVY-COVERED GATES UP IN NEW HAVEN<br>
WHO NEEDS SNOBBERY AND SHRUBBERY AND ALL THAT FROZEN RAIN?<br>
LET'S GO DANCING!<br>
ON LELAND AND LELAND AND JANE!
<p>
NOW, LET'S GET DOWN AND PLAY<br>
IT'S A HEDONISTIC, MAUSOLISTIC, MUPPETATIONAL FRAY<br>
GET CRAZY!  CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO LOSE!<br>
FORGET YOUR SUID, JUST BRING YOUR ID AND A PAIR OF DANCING SHOES!
<p>
IN CAMBRIDGE THEY'RE STILL STUDYIN', IN PRINCETON THEY'RE BEHAVIN'<br>
THEY'RE BORED OUT OF THEIR  IVY-COVERED MINDS UP IN NEW HAVEN <br>
WHO NEEDS READIN', WRITIN', `RITHMETIC -- WE'VE ONE THING ON OUR  BRAIN!<br>
LET'S GO DANCING!<br>
ON LELAND AND LELAND AND JANE!
<p>
(SONG ENDS)
<p>
<i>[Huge ending. Crowd pees. While the singers are still in tableaux one
of them -- wearing a strange looking button with the letters `S.U.A.T.F.' on
his or her lapel suddenly realizes that she or he is having way too much fun.
She or he turns to his or her neighbor and say to him or her (damn, I hate
this PC gender neutral shit!)... ]</i>
<p>
<b>S/HE:</b>	Hey guys, it's 10:30.
<p>
<b>POCAHANTAS:</b>  Already?
<p>
<i>[All of the people start trotting off to go study and shit, though the
horse continues dancing. *KaNdeE* notices the crowd's departure and
challenges them.]</i>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> Hey, where's everyone going?
<p>
<b>LaTOYA:</b> Sorry.  Chem 31 midterm comin' up.
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> Yeah, in three weeks?! <i>[To one group leaving.]</i>
Come on guys, it's a party.  They haven't even played "Hungry Like the Wolf"
yet.
<p><b>KATO KAELIN:</b> But I have to section lead for Great Works.  And
whoah!, I still don't have that whole Plato cave thing down yet.
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> You <u>got</u> to be kidding me. This is a party! Fuck Plato.
<p>
<b>ERIC ESTRADA:</b>Darn! I haven't checked my e-mail in two hours.
<p><b>STAYPUFF MARSHMALLOW MAN (OR WOMAN):</b>Yeah, and I'm screwed with
3 pages of Sappho to read.
<p>
<b>PARAKEET:</b>There's that research paper I'm doing on the emasculation
of Asian males in Mortal Kombat.
<p>
<b>KAREL:</b><i>[Assuming we actually have someone in a Karel costume --
see Mary for that cardboard box and tin foil.] </i>Oh, that's my beeper.
Gotta run. <i>[To leave, Karel turns left then left, and then walks off.]</i>
<p>
<b>OTHERS:</b><i>[Leaving and mumbling something on the lines of:]</i> Come
on, let's go.  Crap.  Gotta go.  Motor.
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>Come back -- it's Halloween! The Great Pumpkin hasn't even
come yet. Hey Linus, You're still with me aren'tcha?
<p>
<i>[Someone dressed as much like Charles Schultz's Linus as is possible
without shaving anyone's head shakes his head `No,' clutches his blanket and
leaves. Only three figures remain: Myra and Hobart sharing a horse costume;
*KaNdeE*; and Jeremy. The horse still dances wildly, like Mr. Ed on crack.]</i>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b><i>[To the horse.] </i>Can you believe this? Everyone's gone.
<p><b>HORSE:</b><i>[Finally notices what's going on and stops dancing.]</i>
What the hay?
<p>
<i>[Rim Shot. Myra and Professor Hobart step out of the costume.]</i>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>Oh no. But Professor Hobart, I thought this was the biggest
party of the year.
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	That <u>was</u> the biggest party of the year, Myra. But
it used to be even better. In fact, back in the pre-alcohol policy Kennedy
years we used have hot and cold running `shroom milkshakes at this party. One
year I could have sworn I saw little Leland come out of that building right
there and do the hustle. <i>[Trying to be cooler than he is.]</i> Those were
the days, man. Back in the summer of `69... played until my fingers bled.
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>I'm so disillusioned! My first Mausoleum party, and it's a
disaster.
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>Yeah, I was looking forward to my semi-annual walk of shame
too.  But everyone bailed.
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>Oh my, I guess I'll have to `X' off the Mausoleum party.
<i>[Consults and updates checklist.] </i> Well, it seems there are still a
heap of wacky Stanford things I can do. OK, I've been to MuFuUnSun
<i>[Knocking each item off with a proud check.],</i> became a Stanford woman
at Full Moon on the Quad, squeezed into a horse costume with my RF... Hmm...
According to my Official Axe Comm Handbook, I still can play Frisbee golf, go
fountain-hopping, scream primally and hey! We can explore the steam tunnels!
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Well, Myra, that sounds like a swell idea.  Yessiree,
downright fun.
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> Yeah, that is a great idea. And luckily, I'm dressed as a
Peruvian tin miner. <i>[Clicks on the little light on her little hat
--`ping.']</i> Let's boogie.
<p>
<i>[*KaNdeE* opens up a personhole cover (i.e.  the trap door). Jeremy
strolls out from behind a small rock or something.]</i>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b> Hey, what are you guys doing?
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b><i>[Calls to Jeremy.]</i> Hey you.
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Name's Jeremy.
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Okay, Jeremy -- would you like to come out with us?
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	You're gay?
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	No, we're going down the steam tunnels.
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Oh, cool, I guess so. <i>[Lines up with them, then notices
they are alone.] </i> Whoa, where did everybody go?
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>They all went home to study.
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Stupid lemmings. They never suck the marrow from their
<u>diems</u>. The overeducated fools. They just follow the paths beaten by
their ex-hippie, hypocritical parents and never know what they're missing.
Not me, man... I'm going spelunkin'!
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> Alright everybody, follow me.  Geronimoooooooooo-- !
<p>

<h3>Scene II:  DOWN THE TUNNELS</h3>
<p>
<b>(Whoah, the imagery)</b>
<p>
<i>[*KaNdeE* dives into the trap door followed by the rest of the crew.  Hobart
first, Myra, then Jeremy.  Now, listen up:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>By this time the stage has been cleared of all remnants of the  Mausoleum
party and the stage is now "the steam tunnels." (Drop black mid-stage maybe?)
One by one, at the exact moment they drop into the trap door, each character
magically reappears from upstage-right -- it's their body doubles! Cool, huh?
They enter the stage in darkness (with *KaNdeE*'s Peruvian light leading the
way) and they cross the stage. We hear echoes and drips and running water and
basically all the nifty stuff that you might hear while steam tunneling.</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>The following is a VOICE OVER, pre-recorded, unless of course the body
doubles sound amazingly like our real characters. They walk and crawl across
the stage once, dramatically acting out the dialogue as they go.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>HOBART:	</b>As long as we'll be spelunking together, let's play a fun
get to know each other game, like "Crossing the line." So, any of you ever seen
a grown man naked? <i>[silence]</i> No one? Well then, <i>[to *KaNdeE*]</i> how
`bout we just start with your name.<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:	</b>Mine's *KaNdeE*.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Well *KaNdeE*, have you been down here before?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Of course Professor Hobart -- this is where Splinter taught me
the way of the ninja.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	So you're a ninja <u>and</u> a Dollie?<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	I dumped<b> </b>Hum Bio core and had some free
time.[<i>to Myra]</i> So who are you?<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[They have crossed the stage once, and as each of them exits their
corresponding characters walk in from the opposite side. This is all
choreographed brilliantly.]<b></b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	<i>[perky]</i> My name's Myra. Myra Dinkelspiel.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Oh.  So that's how you got in?<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>MYRA: </b>	I am not a legacy! <i>[All snotty.]</i> And what's your costume
Jeremy? Ethan Hawke from "Reality Bites" or Matt Dillon in "Singles"?<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:	</b><i>[Flails arms wildly as befitting someone who's acting out
lines he's not really saying.]  </i>Hey, man. That was my <u>life</u> up there
on that screen. That's my generation. <i>[Poetically.]</i> "Oh Winona,
wherefore whilst thou be mine own grunge queen." <i>[All proud.]</i>   That's
from a song I wrote.  By myself.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>MYRA:	</b><i>[Looking perplexed.]  </i>Um, guys, where are we?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Uhh... I've got it all under control. Really. My training
forbids me from getting lost.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	They teach Dollies map reading?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	No, dammit, my <u>ninja</u> training.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:	</b>Whatever, man, whatever.  <i>[Becoming increasingly
panicked.]</i>  I don't like being underground for too long, you know. I'm
starting to get "Fraggle Rock" flashbacks. Oh my god! Is that a Dooser?
<i>[Gasp.]</i>  The Trash Heap!!<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i>[They have crossed the stage again. At this point both sets of four back
onto center stage where they, literally, bump into one another. The faux-four
run off screaming. Voice over ends.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>BODY DOUBLES:</b>   Ahhhhh!<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Hey kids, let's see what's up there.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Yeah, what is that, a light or something?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	I've never been down this far.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Whoah, <i>[Pointing across the stage.]</i> what is that?<p>
<p>
<i>[A light appears over stage left, revealing "The Axe-Files" -- a shabby,
hidden corner of nowhere filled with shelves and cabinets and, of course,
files. Think of the library in "The Shawskank Redemption," that is, before Tim
Robbins got the money from the government to renovate it.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>At the desk of the Axe Files is Maynard, an ancient librarian upon whose
face the sun has not shone in decades. When he does, he talks like an senile
old hick. They approach the desk.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>MYRA:</b>	I don't know... Hello?<p>
<p>
<i>[Maynard doesn't notice them.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>MYRA:</b>	Hello! Mr. Man?<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[He continues to be oblivious, the old fool. Hobart picks up note on
librarian's desk and reads it.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>HOBART: 	</b>Says here:  "Ring bell for service."  <i>[He rings the
bell.]</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>MAYNARD:   </b><i>[The librarian suddenly springs to life.]  </i>Stanford
ID, please.  <p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b> 	Um, Sir?<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Maynard. My name, missy, is Maynard. How can I help ye'?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> 	What is this place?  <p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:    </b>You don't know?<i>[Uh-uh.]  </i>Ahhh, novices. This, kiddos,
is... <i>[Orchestra hit.]  </i>THE AXE FILES. The hidden, mythic repository of
everything you wanted to know about Stanford University. And ye' can't check
out nuthin' without a valid, genuine student I.D.<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Wait. What kind of stuff do you mean?<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Everything -- all them secrets that've been hidden from
student ears for generations.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Damn administration.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Wowsers. Let's take a look!<p>
<p>
<i>[They all pull out their Fall quarter SUIDs. Myra pulls out an enormous
poster sized one -- covered with holograms -- which everyone looks at
quizzically. Her full name is printed on it MYRA DINKELSPIEL from Greenbow,
Alabama.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	What is that thing?<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	It's the new universal SUID. <i>[Points.]</i> See? Laser printed
picture.<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:   </b><i>[Sees `1995' on cards.] </i> 1995? Already? Ooh boy, I
guess that Nancy Sinatra ain't as firm as she used to be. Let's see here.
<i>[Looks at Myra's.]</i> Myra <u>Dinkelspiel</u>. Heh-heh, so's that how you
got in here?<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	I am not a legacy!<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Sure ya' ain't.<i>[They all go through and begin perusing the
files.] </i>Go ahead, check `em out, they're all here. All the books, all the
files. Some hot titles are: <i>[Lifts them up as he lists.]</i> "Naked Lunch --
memoirs of a Synergy hasher"... got the floor plans for Memorial Synagogue...
Ah, and here's my personal favorite: "The Best Little Whorehouse on Axess."
<i>[Nudging Jeremy.]</i>  I bet you always wondered why them sororities lost
their houses!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	I have a question. How come the Row houses only have parties one
at a time rather than monstrous multi-house bacchanalian block parties? I mean
Res Ed totally nixed my idea for the Sigma Chi/Muwekma "Trail of Tears"
party.<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   <i>[Yanks out another file.]  </i>Why don't you take a gander
at this baby: "The War of the Rowses" That should clear things up.<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Look! It's a <u>wartime diary</u>.  Hmm... "It was the cold
winter of 1942.  Tensions among the theme dorms ran high.  The battle lines
were drawn and for three long days we waited... "<p>
<b><i>Scene III:  THE WAR OF THE ROWSES</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><i></i><p>
<i>[Alsace the Unknown Soldier climbs out of the pit, enveloped in dry ice.  He
sits up against the proscenium and pulls out a Powerbook. A plug lowers from
the juliet and he plugs in. We hear that "Welcome to Macintosh" sound. He
begins typing, and strangely enough he speaks what he is typing out loud.  In
the background we hear gunfire.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>ALSACE:</b>	My Dearest Lorraine. It is I, Alsace.  I am writing to
you from the trenches of La Maison Fran&ccedil;aise.  The opposing troops are
gathered along Mayfield.  I don't know if this letter will reach you.  Our
lines of communication have been severed by Haus Mitt, and I have been unable
to read my e-mail for hours.  I pray every day for peace, but I'm beginning to
think I may never return to your tiny Flo Mo single again.  I do not know how
much news you have been receiving from the Daily or KZSU... hmm...
<i>[Backspacing]</i> from the Daily.  Here is the story as I have seen it
unfold.  As tensions between the French and Germans began to mount, the ASSU
sponsored an intense round of peace talks. <p>
<p>
<i>[Curtain opens on a long table at which are sitting representatives from
each of the Row Houses, each dressed in stereotypical garb -- because
stereotypes are funny: Amstud as Uncle Sam; Slav Dom as a caribou; Storey as
Little Bo Peep; et cetera. Amstud, who may very well talk like Foghorn Leghorn,
is the mediator. He is wearing a sweatshirt reading "I'm a Peace Talk Mediator,
Silly!"]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>AMSTUD:</b>	As the neutral representative from the American Studies Theme
House, I'd like to welcome everyone to the peace talks between La Maison
Francaise and Haus Mittleuropa.  All right, are we ready to begin?  Let's
see...  <i>[Looking at who's there]</i>  Casa Italiana, Slavinski Dom, BOB,
Muwekma-ta-Ruk, Xanadu...  <i>[No one's in the Xanadu seat]</i> Hey, now
where's the representative from Xanadu?<p>
<p>
<i>[Olivia Newton John rollerskates in.  How do we know it's her, you ask?  We
thought you'd ask that.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>OLIVIA:</b>	<i>[With Australian accent.]</i>   Sorry I'm late.  I ran into
Kinicki at the Drive In.<p>
<p>
<b>AM STUD:	</b>OK, OK<i>.  [Checking list.]</i><b>  </b>Sigma Chi.
Columb&aelig;.<b> </b>Hey-who put `Betas' on the list?  <i>[Bernie raises his
hand.]</i>   Bernie, get the hell out of here.<p>
<p>
<b>BERNIE:</b>	But we've almost got enough pledges! We're getting our house
back, I swear!<p>
<p>
<b>AM STUD:</b>	I've heard that one before.  Take him away. <i>[Gerard
Depardieu hustles him unceremoniously offstage.] </i>  Now let's bring in the
conflicting parties.  First, the representatives from Haus Mitt.<p>
<p>
<i>[The German troops arrive, all bitter and hostile as they head towards the
peace talks table.  Dieter the RA is commanding his troops: six soldiers,
ordered in descending height and dressed as the Von Trapp family.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>DIETER:</b> 	<i>[Blows his whistle.]</i>  Now is the time at Haus Mitt where
we to count off.<p>
<p>
<b>LIESEL:</b>	My name is Liesel, Sir! Ja!<p>
<p>
<b>FRIEDRICH:</b>  Friedrich! Ja!<p>
<p>
<b>BRIGITTA:</b>	Brigitta! Ja!<p>
<p>
<b>KURT:</b>	Kurt! Ja!<p>
<br><b>LOUISA:</b>	Louisa! Ja!<p>
<p>
<b>MARTA:</b>	Marta! Ja!<p>
<p>
<b>GRETL:</b>	Gretl! Ja!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>HEIDI:</b>	Heidi! Ja!<p>
<p>
<b>DIETER:</b>	Heidi! It is past your bedtime! Go to sleep!<p>
<p>
<b>HEIDI:</b>	<i>[Dragging herself up the stairs.]</i>  The sun, has gone, to
bed and so 		must I...<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>AMSTUD:</b>	And now, the representatives from La Maison Francaise.<p>
<p>
<i>[The French troops enter, led by NAPOLEON the RA. They wear berets and
striped shirts, of course. One of them is in mime face paint.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>	Attention, soldats!  Ditez!  Escargot!<p>
<p>
<b>ESCARGOT:</b>	Oui!	<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>	Bordeaux!<p>

<i>[The mime one steps forward and says nothing loudly.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>DIETER:</b>	Sir, you will please note dat the French representatives
have arrived late.<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>  <i>[Throws a Daily on the table.]  </i>Today's Once Around
The Quad clearly states the peace talks begin at 12:30.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>DIETER:</b>	You bastard.  I demand satisfaction!  <i>[Moves to slap
him with his glove and is halted by Am Stud.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>AMSTUD:</b>	Easy, now.  Let's see if we can't get you all reconciled.
Without shooting one another, that is.  Dieter, Napoleon-- you may take your
seats.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[The leaders take their seats at the heads of the table. Their respective
troops crowd behind them.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>AMSTUD:</b>	We'll hear major complaints from the French House
representative first.  Napoleon?<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>  Zeir muzik, it is too loud. All those tubas and accordions
and their "Ja Ja's." It is enough to drive a man mad. Mad I says!<p>
<p>
<b>DIETER:</b>	Oh, unt your crowd ist so greaten.  Your cheezes, dey smell up
all of Mayfield. Und you are always taking up all de gut parking schpaces.

<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>  You did not invite us to your annual Oktoberfest party!

Fez! play and know that you are not welcomed?<p>
<p>
<b>DIETER:</b>	You held unt dorm program raiding our kitchen!<p>
<p>
<b>AMSTUD:	</b>Okay, okay.  Settle down.<p>
<p>
<b>ALSACE:</b>	<i>[From side stage.]</i> For a few days we were hopeful.  It
looked as if everything would be resolved at the talks.  Then, on the
twenty-first day of the peace talks, the pizza arrived... P-day.<p>
<p>
<i>[Alan Diba from the SUATF Pizza Co. arrives causing a momentary silence.]
</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>AMSTUD:</b>	And if ya'll just sign these treaties we can have just
about everything settl--<i>[Notices a pizza guy.] </i>Hey... did someone order
a pizza?<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>ALAN DIBA:</b>    I've got a large pizza here with escargots and
sauerkraut.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Everyone points their guns at him.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>ALAN DIBA:</b>    Look, I don't carry more than $20 in cash!<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>     Ze escargot!  It is mine!<p>

<b>DIETER:</b>  	Ach, scheisse!<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>   C'est a moi! <i>[A warcry.]  </i>Death before sauerkraut!<p>
<p>
<i>[The battle begins and the Row becomes wartorn. Barbed wired and sandbags
fly everywhere. There are slow-motion fights in the trenches; guns are hurled
back and forth; everything is covered in bodies, croissants, huge bottles of
Dijon Mustard, Cheetos, and a barricade of bicycles. People keep riding over
land mines on bikes and exploding. Alsace types while the slo-mo continues in
the background.] </i><p>
<p>
<b>ALSACE:</b>	And so the battle began.  It has lasted for two months now. If
the fighting continues we will all be forced to pay Summer Quarter room and
board.  My dearest Lorraine, I am sorry to say that this will be the last
letter you will receive from me.  I must go into hiding, for I have joined
<u>La Resistance</u>.  I cannot reveal any more -- perhaps I have said too much
already.  Farewell, my love. <i>[Closes Powerbook.]</i><p>
<i> </i><p>
<i>[The battle goes fast-mo now, and each side advances alternately.  When the
French advance, a French song (Marseillaise/Alouette/Frere Jacques/CanCan/Do
You Hear the People Sing) plays, and when the Germans advance a German song
plays.  There is no clear winner-- it's a back-and-forth struggle.  Alsace
joins the fray." Alsace spray paints "Wolverines" on a tank, then gets
shot.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>ALSACE:</b>	<i>[To himself]</i> Merde! Perhaps La Maison shall be liberated,
but I shall not live to see freedom shine upon its lounge.  I only regret that
I have but one life to give for my theme dorm.  I have paid dearly for my
priority. <i>[Looking upwards.]</i> Always remember your dearest Alsace,
Lorraine.  And pray that heaven has in-room connections.<p>

<i><b>Scene III(b):  THE WAR to SPOKESRIVAL</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i><b></b>[In front of red, coming back from the War of the Rowses.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	So what happened after that?<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	<i>[Reading] </i>It says here that it took years for the houses to
trust each other again. After the war, Haus Mitt was forced to pay all of their
ASSU special fees. And up until the 1980's it was divided in half so that it
would never be able to steal the pat&eacute; away from La Maison Francaise
again.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b> 	I remember the parties in the western half of the house...
grooving to the sounds of that guy from Knight Rider... while the other half of
the house lived a dreary and moribund existence. <p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>  	Sort of like Flo Mo. <i>[Rim shot.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b> 	What a day that was when the wall came a tumblin' down.
<i>[Light goes on inside cranium.]</i> Not unlike the Berlin Wall.<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   What's that about the wall? It's down?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>  	How long have you been down here, anyway?<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Since 1895... <i>[Reminiscing]</i> Ah... the glory days. Back
then, tailgating out by the Branner Swamp... we won the Big Game that year 103
ta' nuthin'. Course that's not all that impressive, since there was no opposing
team. <i>[They don't get it.]</i> You see that was way back before Cal was our
rival.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b> 	 What?  You mean Cal wasn't always our rival?<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>  Don'tcha think it strange that a place like Stanford got stuck
with a second-rate state school like Cal for competition?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	I never thought of it that way. Yeah, how <u>did</u> they get to
be our rival?<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD :</b>  There's a file on that right over here.  <i>[Funny that.]</i>
Yep, back then we always won Big Game. Course we weren't playing football, it
was a greased-pig catchin' contest.  Why I remember this one pig, name o'
Willy... best damn rump I ever see--<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b> 	<i>[Reading file, cutting him off.]</i>  Hey, it says right
here that Cal wasn't our rival until <u>1956</u>, when Congress passed the
Greased Pig Protection Act, and Stanford had to find a new sport to play.
Luckily about that time, a new sport was sweeping the nation: "football." But
for that game, Stanford needed a rival.<p>

<i><b>Scene IV:  A FEW GOOD RIVALS</b></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Lights out. Blackness. Red opens and spotlights swirl. Wow, what drama. A
game show cheese theme plays in the darkness (i.e., duh nana nuh nuh nana
nuh-nuh) and ends with a big drum roll and cymbal smash! </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Pstsshshcchhh!</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>A spotlight lands on Guy and Gal Smiley standing in their evening attire
holding microphones. The stage is set for a beauty pageant.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>GUY SMILEY:</b><i>   </i>Hello everybody, this is Guy Smiley! <p>
<p>
<b>GAL SMILEY:   </b>And this is Gal Smiley, welcome back to our pageant!  <p>
<p>
<b>GUY:	</b>We're now down to five finalists!  But only <u>one</u> will gain
the prestigious title of...<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Drum roll plays. A huge, expensive, flashing sign that says "Spokesrival
Competition" lights up.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>BOTH:	</b>... Stanford University's Spokesrival!<p>
<p>
<i>[Much canned applause with abrupt ending.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>GAL:	</b>For those of you just joining us, here are the highlights of last
night's evening gown competition. Prepare to be amazed by the poise and
elegance of our finalists as they show us how they spend a night on the town.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Slides of evening gown competition appear overhead. The Smileys describe
each contestant as each slide is shown. Note: the contestants are </i>not<i>
all female (adjust spoken pronouns as necessary) however, they all do wear
their respective evening gowns.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The first slide is of M.I.T. contestant -- it shows her at Miyake's in a
naughahyde dress and weird ass necklace. She's posing at the sushi bar.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GUY:	</b>M.I.T. wows the head chef at Miyake's with a saucy
pr&ecirc;t-&agrave;-porter naugahyde number. Being the well accessorized
<i>femme fatale</i> that she is, M.I.T. combines form and fashion with her
double helix necklace. Folks, don't be fooled.  Underneath those bulletproof
glasses is one sassy dame.<p>
<p>
<i>[Second slide: Harvard contestant.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Harvard orders a Perrier on the rocks at <i>Il Fornaio</i> in a
stuffy gray woolen number. The fact that her date never showed up doesn't
bother her. She's a smart, independent woman with an attitude, a legacy, and a
vibrator.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Third slide: Berkeley contestant. Guy Smiley is disgusted at Berkeley's
presence and rushes through the description.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>GUY:	</b>Berkeley... rummages through a dumpster in a ratty polyester
moo-moo? She's found a.... hey!... that's my trashcan! That's my...<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[The next slide is immediately shown: Sally Struther's Correspondence
School.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Chill, Guy. Sally Struther's Correspondence School is waiting for
take-out in a mail order jumpsuit from Sears. Her look is chic. She's
flirtatious, but not to be messed with.... thanks to her advanced degree in Gun
Repair.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Final slide: a Klansman, painting `KKK' on a wall.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GUY:</b>	This Klansman, dressed from head to toe in virgin white, is out to
paint the town red. Look at how that sheet falls -- 100% southern cotton.<p>
<p>
<i>[End of slide show.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Now, are you ready for the swimsuit competition? <i>[crowd cheers]
</i>You should know that the swimsuit competition continues due to <u>your</u>
interest. A campus wide poll was taken to see how you felt about the swimsuit
competition... and here are the results: <i>[Slide: A mock-up of Stanford
Snapshots, a la Diversions, reading, "BUTT WHAT DO YOU THINK?: A scant 17% of
Stanford students said they'd rather not see the Spokesrivals contestants
scantily clad in the swimsuit competition." Appropriate graphic included, of
course.] </i>So Yes! Come on out girls! And let's hear it for the Stanford
Spokesrival finalists!<p>
<p>
<i>[Canned applause plays. The contestants walk out, wearing name tags  if
necessary. M.I.T is in some silver cyber-swimsuit; Harvard is in a granny suit;
Berkeley is naked (a bandanna?); Sally Struther's Correspondence School is in a
flashy Pamela Anderson-esque thong thing; and, Klansman is in the same sheet (a
Holiday Inn logo is clearly recognizable on it). They parade about.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>And now, the final round:  The Interview.  We invite one of our
very special guest judges, Hugh Grant, to bring in the interview question.
Welcome Hugh!<p>
<p>
<i>[Hugh Grant comes out -- He's gay? -- and zips up his fly. He stammers and
blinks throughout his speech.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>HUGH:	</b>H-H-Hello. I just <u>blew</u> in from Engl-- Oh bugger! Damn. I-I
didn't mean to offend, but I really needed the <u>job</u>. Oh bugger! I-I'm
sorry, I-I'm really just trying to get ahead here. Damn! Bugger. Bloody
bollocks. B-b-but I do have this question, I-I suppose I should just go ahead
and <u>come</u> out with it. Oh, bugger! Bugger! Alright, fine! I did it! I
paid for it and I'd do it again. Hurley wasn't doing me right! Best forty bucks
I ever spent!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[He storms off. Someone holds up a sign saying, "I'd do it for free
Hugh!"]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GUY:	</b>Err, thank you Hugh. And the interview question is... <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Drum roll.]</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>GAL:	</b>If a hot momma asked you out on Friday to go to a movie on Sunday
but your `Sassy' magazine horoscope said you should stay in all weekend, what's
the capital of Peru?<p>
<p>
<i>[Cymbal crash. Ptshshcchhhhh!  Jeopardy music plays as contestants search
for the right answer. They write their answers down.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Time's up.  M.I.T., your answer please?<p>
<p>
<b>M.I.T.:	</b><i>[Holds up card and answers.] </i>The natural log of
X-squared.<p>
<p>
<b>GAL:</b>	Ooh.  I'm sorry.  Sally Struthers Correspondence School?  Your
answer please?<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SALLY:	</b>Sorry.  I only read `Bop.'   I canceled my `Sassy' subscription
in the 12th grade.<p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Better luck next time. Berkeley? Your answer?<p>
<p>
<i>[Berkeley raises card... there's nothing on it.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GUY:</b>	Okay... <i>[Gives Berkeley a weird yet wacky look.] </i> Harvard?<p>
<p>
<b>HARVARD:  </b><i>[Holds up card.] </i>What is... Lima?<p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Yes, that's right! And let's see what our last contestant has.<b>
</b>You, in the white, your answer please.<p>
<p>
<i>[Klansmen holds up card.  It says "Burn in Hell."]</i><p>
<p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Ooh.  Good answer.<p>
<p>
<b>GAL:</b><i>	</i>Judges, can we accept the Klansman's answer?  <p>
<p>
<b>HUGH:</b>	<i>[Yells from offstage.] </i>Bugger!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>GAL:	</b>Well,<b> </b>the answer is actually Lima but "Burn in Hell" is a
much more detestable answer! Congratulations! You've won the interview round!
Looks like we might have our winner, eh Guy?<p>
<p>
<b>HARVARD:</b>  Dammit! I'll kill her!<p>
<p>
<i>[Harvard pulls out a knife and gesticulates wildly. She is restrained and
carried off stage.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>GAL:</b>	<i>[As if reading from cue card.] </i> I'd hate to be her
roommate tonight.<p>
<p>

onto the stage. He whispers into Guy's ear, hands him a new envelope, and then
leaves with the old one.]</i><b></b><p>

<b>GUY:</b>	Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that there has been a
disqualification. According to pageant by-laws that I have just been informed
of, all contestants are required to reveal their identities or else be
disqualified from the competition. <i>[Looks over at the Klansman.]</i> Sorry.
<i>[Guy looks back at audience.]</i> Ladies and Gentleman, the winner, the new
Stanford University Spokesrival is....  <i>[More drum rolls.]  </i>Cal?!?<p>
<p>
<i>[There's  no applause. Cal is crowned and cries -- there's mascara
everywhere, like that chick on the cover of that Hole album. Everyone stands
dumbstruck that Cal should have won.]</i><p>

<b><i>Scene IVb:  RIVALS TO CANADA</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	<i>[Still reading.]</i> And even though everyone was
flabbergasted at the time, the Stanford-Cal rivalry became one of the most
fiercely fought in history, comparable only to Bud Bowl 4.<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Yep, but I sure `nuff miss them piggies.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	<i>[Leafing through handbook.] </i>But according to my Axe Comm
Handbook, Cal has been our rival since 1891!<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Damn publication. That's what they'd <u>like</u> you to think!
Now we know the truth! We have to bring this knowledge to the rest of
Stanford!<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Whoa there -- I don't reckon that's such a good idea.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Why not?<p>
<p>
<b>MAYNARD:</b>   Well, the last folks who tried to spread the word about

<i>[Hands them file with big maple leaf thingy on it.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	It's about a semester abroad program.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	A semester a broad? A broad a semester? That's not a bad average
at all. <i>[Nudges *KaNdeE*]</i> Especially on a quarter system.<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	<i>[She flicks his nose.]  </i>What's it say Myra?<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Well... <i>[Reading to himself.]</i> Wow! In 1967, Stanford opened
an experimental overseas center. Their mission statement read: <i>[Reads
stiffly from the file.]</i> "In order to draw students away from the more
popular overseas programs and to explore our continent more fully, we intend to
absorb Stanford students into a truly unique, new and often underappreciated
culture." Fourteen students found themselves on a run for the border.<p>

Canadian accent, is on horseback. He is speaking to a group of Stanford

<b>MONTY:</b>	Well, remember kids, it's going to take some getting used to.

a new language.  You're a long way from Palo Alto.  This is the real world --

<i>[Everyone nods in agreement.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>YERTLE:</b>	And what did you mean by "practically a new language?"<p>
<p>
<b>MONTY:</b>	Well, let me explain it to you. We know how you see us, but
Canada is a great country all on its own. We're not simply the Jan Brady of the
North American family... the jealous, less talented younger sibling, always
hidden in the shadow of her prettier, more heavily armed older sister.<p>

<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	<i>[Refers to what she was reading.]</i> Check this out. I
found something about the cancellation of <u>The Masturbation Theme House</u>
in 1991. They said it created an antisocial dorm atmosphere:  Everyone had a
single; all the furniture had slip covers; the lines for the tub room ran
around the corner; and no one could ever find any of the TAs... But then when
someone lost the dorm squeegee they finally had to yank it. <i>[Rim

"Activities"... BMX Club Secretary, Hall Monitor, 4th grade. What else?
"Awards"... fifteenth caller KOME. Captain of the dodgeball team. Voted

"Gleek Club."  That should just about finish it. <i>[Turns page over.]</i>
"Essay".... <u>Essay</u>?! Damn.  No one ever said anything about writing! "Jot

<i>[Montoya again speaks in tongues to his brimstone-lackeys. He hands them
Fred's application and commands them to start working on it. The lackeys align
at a row of typewriters and get to work on it, assembly-line style. Montoya

<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	<i>[A la Joey Lawrence.]</i> Whoah!<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	You know, Jeremy is totally right. It seems that Stanford isn't
the proud, glorious, grade-inflated, over-priced haven I thought it would be.
There's just something wrong about this place.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	You've got a point there Myra. Things just haven't been the same
around Stanford lately. Things used to be so... so fun. God the Carter years
were great! And being a grad student was never anything to be ashamed of. We
weren't dorks at all. We were downright hip. Nope, you'd never see me tucking
my afro into any bike helmet. How sad.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Not as sad as those poor students stranded in Saskatchewan. How
could they just leave them there? In Canada of all places.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Hey! Canada's not so bad. They've got Kentucky Fried Chicken.
And besides, Douglas Coupland's from Canada. He's my idol, my hero, my avatar,

<b>HOBART:</b>	And that other file, about that war. Imagine the Epcot Showcase

He never gets your order right. Or delivers on time. Or accepts competitors'

<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	And that awful contest. Having Cal as a rival makes life hell
for those Yell Leaders. Do you know how hard it is for those ditzes to come up
with cheers that rhyme with `Berkeley?' If we had the KKK as a rival everything
would be so much easier for them. `Fan,' `can,' `ran,' `tan,' `ban'... it's so
easy. <p>

<b>JEREMY:</b>	Then just read the abstract.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	"After decades of effort our plan is reaching its climax. Our
objective: sucking the fun out of Stanford. Several stages have been completed
successfully thus far, namely: plaguing Stanford with an unworthy rival;
reviving the `F'; starting and maintaining the War of the Rowses; infesting the
campus with acerbic and unsightly graduate students; the cancellation of the
Bonfire tradition for the sake of a salamander species which has been extinct
since 1856; the continuous rain of Spring `95; <i>et cetera</i>. Several
failures have been experienced as well, most notably: the," quote,
"<u>improved</u> graduation procession, and The Stanford in Canada programme.
Though the Canada programme was established to provide a fail-safe fun-free
overseas environment, the members of Stanford in Canada had," quote, "`<u>a
rockin' good time</u>.' Ergo, the programme was terminated."<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Wait. They wanted them to have a <u>bad</u> time? I don't--<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	There's more here. "The all encompassing final phase of the
SUATF program will take place in November of 1995" -- <i>&lt;gasp&gt;</i> --
"Big Game Week. It ensures that all fun will be sucked out of Stanford once and
for all. As of this time, no more Stanford students will be admitted to Pali
High Senior Proms, we will have removed all grape Fruit Loops from Dining
Services, and all fonts to be replaced with Helvetica. Most importantly, all"
quote, "<u>fun</u> Big Game Week activities will be disrupted, culminating in
the cancellation of Big Game itself."<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	That sucks.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	And that emblem on the cover... we've seen that somewhere
before.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Yeah, doesn't Lenny Kravitz have a tattoo just like it?<p>

steam pipe thirty feet above. I ignored the searing pain, but now I bear the
mark of my enemy. <i>[*KaNdeE* puts up her right hand to show the SUATF

convince him to take some time to see this great big world, to try and make
some sort of difference, to save the burning orphans! But all he wanted to do
was ride around on his Schwinn with his pants tucked into his socks. I tried to
get him help, so I went to the Admissions Office. I figured Dean Montoya could
do <u>something</u>. But when I knocked on his door, everything went black.
When I awoke, I was shackled to this wall. I've been here ever since.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	<i>[Pointing to Monty]</i> And weren't you with Stanford in
Saskatchewan... <i>[Nods yes.]</i> And, wait... Who's that freak in black?<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>   That is Dieter.<p>
<p>
<b>DIETER:</b> 	Oooh, oooh, oooh... <i>[He moves his hand out of the shackle
and smacks himself on the face, then slips his hand back in when they mention
his name.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	<i>[Pointing to Napoleon and Dieter.]</i> That's right. You guys
used to live on the Row.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	<i>[Pointing to Gal.]</i> And you tried to help Stanford find a
rival!<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	So this is what happened!<p>
<p>
<b>NAPOLEON:</b>    Oui, we have all tried to rise up against the forces of the
SUATF... and we have all been their prisoners ever since.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b> 	Damn incarceration!<p>
<p>
<i>[Organ plays Fugue in D-minor, by Bach. A huge door creaks open. The Rather
Short Hunchbacked Phantom of Mem Chu enters pushing a wheel barrow full of
slop. He talks somewhat like a British Rip Taylor.]</i><p>

<b>MONTY:</b>	He's coming back!<p>
<p>
<b>OTHERS:</b>	Fear!<p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>  Wakey wakey!!  Dinnertime, ladies and gentlemen.  Everybody
hungry? <i>[Drags a tin plate across the bars of the cell.]</i> Come on, come
on! Who's hungry?<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Where are we?<p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>   We're in the secret dungeon of Memorial Church.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Memorial Church?  With the redwood ceilings, the derivative
artwork, and the 7,777 organ pipes? <i>[Everyone stares at her.]</i>  Sorry, I
took the tour.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	If we're in Mem Chu, that makes you...?<p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>   Yes! <i>[Dramatic cheese]</i> I am <u>The Rather Short
Hunchbacked Phantom of Memorial Church</u>. And I take my job quite
seriously.<p>
<p>
<b>ALL:</b> 	What are you going to do to us?<p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>   You're scheduled for about eight years of heinous torture
at my able, albeit shaky hands. <i>[Waves hands at audience -- they pee.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	Eight years!? I'm up for tenure in three.<p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>    Oh, shut up.<p>
<p>
<b>DIETER:</b> 	You down there! It's time for my beating! <p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>   I just beat you this morning.<p>
<p>
<i>[Dieter continues moaning, sad because he didn't get beaten again.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	You can't do this to me! My roommate's parents are on the
Supreme Court.  <p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>   Hey! I didn't choose to do this! Look at me... I'm a
phantom and I'm a hunchback. I have a huge lump on my back and I hide in old
buildings where I scare people! What else am I going to do for a living,
management consulting? SUATF hires me... I torture. I'm happy. They even got
dental <i>[He smiles (ding!) and even though he's hideous he does happen to
have nice teeth.]</i> Now it's time to get to work. Here's a nice little
torture I picked up from the Shining Path. Hmm... where did I leave that
Karaoke machine? Ah, over here.<p>
<p>
<i>[The Hunchback selects a song and moseys centerstage with a microphone. The
first few bars of "Islands in the Stream" begin to play. The record scratches
and much hipper 50's doo-wop starts up.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The floor lights up like in the "Billie Jean" video... heck, pull down a
disco ball. The Hunchback's huge shadow dances on the wall of the dungeon
though he remains still. When he sings</i> <i>those shackled to the wall become
our lil' doo-wop background singers that, get this, dance while stuck to the
wall -- hilarity is ours!!]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>	Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here this evening.

(SONG ENDS)<p>
<p>
<b>HUNCHBACK:</b>   Now, the best part of it all is that while you are stuck
here enjoying my unadulterated sadism, the final plan of the SUATF is being
implemented throughout the Stanford Campus! Haha! Ha! The lingering remnants of
fun are being eradicated -- White Plaza is being Pollianified as we speak.
There will be no more fun, no more frolicking, and no more Bigamy! Oh, is that
right?  <i>[Pulls out a note card and checks it.]  </i>I mean, no more Big
Game! Does that hurt? Does it! Good! No more Big Game! Big Game!<p>
<p>
<i>[As he is rubbing his mirth in their faces a immense warcry is heard. It is
*KaNdeE* coming to save them. She bursts through a wall.]</i><p>

 <p>
<i>[She disposes of the Hunchback (a little karate, [[questiondown]]no?) and
opens the cage by pulling the bars off with her bare hands.] </i><p>

<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	How did you find us?<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	I followed the scent of Camel Lites and Drakaar. <i>[Throws
Jeremy a flannel].</i>  Here's your shirt. We must tell everyone about the evil
SUATF's evil plans!<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	But where can we find a large group of Stanford students who are
willing to listen to anyone?<p>
<p>
<b>EVERYONE:</b>   WHITE PLAZA!<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Yes! Hurry now! You guys go and tell the campus what's going
on. I'll free the others!<p>
<p>
<i>[The three quickly hurry offstage and *KaNdeE*  unshackles everyone else
with the Hunchback's keys.  Dieter is not too happy...]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>DIETER:</b> 	<i>[Trying to climb back up on the wall.]</i> No! I want to
stay! <p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Quiet! We have no time for this foolishness... <i>[There is
murmuring from the others, and a bit of stretching -- heck, they've been up
there for years.]</i> Shh, listen! <i>[We hear footsteps which makes everyone
very nervous, as footsteps in drama tend to do.]</i>  Let's go!<p>
<p>
<i>[They exit stage left, frantically. Just after they exit, in strides Leezza
with five uniformed troops. They all wear SUATF garb, and are clearly bad
guys.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>LEEZZA:</b>	<i>[Surveys the scene for a moment.]</i> Gerhard will be most
displeas&egrave;d.<p>
<p>

of the Hunchback.]</i><p>

<p>
<i>[From off-stage we hear a fear-inducing roar -- a *KaNdeE* body double flips
all the way across the stage to the other side. *KaNdeE* emerges from
off-stage, undaunted. During this scene she keeps switching her accents between
normal *KaNdeE*- speak and Mr. Miyagi syntax.]</i><p>

I'm gonna get your flimsy asses in shape.  Hit it.<p>
<p>
<i>[That obnoxious techno song "Twilight Zone" plays for eight bars: for the
first four bars, *KaNdeE*'s entourage of assistant ninja-dollies come out with
Reebok step-platforms and nunchucks and set them down; for the next four bars,
the same assistants do an impressive choreographed dance routine using the step
platforms and nunchucks.  In the meantime, Ginger et al. are desperately trying
to mimic their dance moves.  Of course, they look tr&eacute;s
pathetique.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The music ends abruptly. The ninja-dollies run off, leaving nunchucks and
platforms behind.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>MONTY:</b>	Where did they learn that?<p>

will show you the way of the three toed yellow bellied monkey dragon.  I will
show you the way of the ginsu-katana-Lantana-samurai.  I will teach you to

the process of transforming it into their haven of ennui. They place signs on
the Claw that read: "Do not touch the water," "No Swimming," "No Wading," "No
Loitering," and "No."  Other signs of boring parties replace the cool ones
(i.e., `Stereogram party at the Zeta Psi house!). Another one advertises a
Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute concert. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>An SUATF worker hands out tweed jackets with leather elbow patches to the
many casually dressed students milling about.  Another is hanging ivy off the
Bird Cage. A Flicks poster advertising "Badman Forever" is replaced with one
that says "Ishtar."</i><p>

<i>Jeremy, Myra, and Hobart enter the scene through the trap door and climb out
right in front of the Post Office. A huge line winds around outside. They
overhear the conversation of Sandy and Randy who talk like Myra would if she

<i></i><p>
<b>RANDY:	</b>Nothing like waiting in line two days for your overnight mail,
huh Sandy?<p>
<p>
<b>SANDY:	</b>I know what you mean Randy.  I have the time to reflect on just
how lucky we are to have our very own post office -- right here on campus!<p>
<p>
<b>RANDY:</b>	You're tellin' it how it is, sister. You know, some people don't
appreciate the U.S. Postal Service, but not us here at Stanford. The friendly
service, the gruntled staff  -- raise the stamp prices higher, I say!<p>
<p>
<b>SANDY:</b>	But I would like to get home soon and rest. I'm still so zonked
from that Mausoleum party. I didn't leave till 10:45. And I had a whole beer
too.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>JEREMY: 	</b>Myra, does something seem strange here?<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA: 	</b>I'll say.  Where are all the hackey sackers?  And what about the

expression of peoples from many lands? Where have all the flowers
gone?<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>JEREMY: 	</b>Yeah, and what about all the lunatics. The criminally

You're jumping for the damn administration!  Where is your spirit, your

<p>
<b>CHET:	</b>Um... yes, of course. She was from... Niagara Falls. You wouldn't

Someone or something has been trying to suck all the fun out of this college,

<i>[A whooping battle cry erupts from the passionate collective voice of the
masses.  Everyone rallies together and prepares to wh&uuml;p some ass. But
then...]</i><p>
<i><b>Scene XI:  THE STORMTROOPERS COMETH -- EWW... GROSSETH</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><b>(A meta-Gaieties)<i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<i>[Just as the student crowd begins to see the light, the sound of marching is
heard. The students begin to express fear. With a call of "Charge!" the whole
fucking SUATF battalion arrives. Most of them are wearing jumpsuits with the
SUATF insignia on the front and back. They are heavily armed with guns and
appliances of suckage: turkey basters, straws, penal pump 3000s, Flow-bees,
Dust Busters, and other vacuums.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>They ooze out of every orifice of Mem Aud stage: Several troops crawl down
the aisles. One man rappels from the balcony. Ken dolls with parachutes fall
from above. Note: This should be a </i><cite>very</cite><i> impressive
assault.</i><p>
<i>Everyone is yelling threats and commands. Audience members are frisked. The
writers are handcuffed and brought on stage. Two huge fascist-looking
Stanford-pine-cone-homecoming-banners are dropped. During  the mayhem an
audience plant -- preferably female and a minority -- is dragged and beaten
senseless by a SUATF member who is male and white. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>After a good amount of chaos the Stanford students run off-stage, pursued by
most of the SUATF team. Several SUATFers stay and keep post at strategic points
of Mem Aud (exits, juliet, etc.) but only five remain on the stage itself:
Disgruntled Alum, My Mother, Newt, Stats Professor and Fisherman. They are
dressed appropriately.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>MY MOTHER:  </b>All right, everybody!  Down on the ground and don't
do anything! Don't move!<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>  	Who are you?<p>
<p>
<b>FISHERMAN:   </b>We're the SUATF and we're here to suck up all the
fun.<i>[Note 2: Every time some one says "Suck up all the fun" the SUATF
members raise their suction devices in the air and make sucking noises.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>ALUM:	</b>We're tired of all the hedonism around here -- MuFuUnSun, the
Junior Formal, Rinc-a-Delt, Gaieties, Big Game festivities...<p>
<p>
<b>STATS PROF:</b>   Our goal is to make Stanford University about as fun as
televised golf.  Each of us is an expert in a specific area of fun suckage.
<i>[Suction devices again.]</i>  For example, I am a statistics professor. And
a <u>Hoover</u> <i>[Vacuum devices.]</i> Fellow.  <p>
<p>
<b>FISHERMAN:</b>   As for me, I am a fisherman.  I catch fish.  Everyday I
sit... in a boat... and I hope to catch some fish.  <p>
<p>
<b>ALUM:	</b>I am an alumnus, Stanford class of 1925.  In my day we didn't have
"fun" at Stanford.  We didn't have parties or indoor plumbing or sunshine.  It
rained all year and we stood thigh high in raw sewage beating each other with
clubs, and we loved it!<p>
<p>
<b>NEWT:</b>	And I am Newt Gingrich.  And when we're done with this place,
there'll be no trace of any ethnicities. <i>[Getting excited.]  </i>Down with
Casa Zah-pah-tah. Away with O' kah-dah. <i>[Really excited.]  </i>This'll be

<p>
<b>FISHERMAN:   </b>Traitor.  He was starting to have too much fun.  <p>
<p>
<i>[Cast, in one motion, wipes their collective brow in relief.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	<i>[To Mother.] </i>What about you? You look oddly familiar.<p>
<p>
<b>MOTHER:	</b>I am Bertha Swanson, President of the Mothers' Club.  I speak
for all of your mothers and they are not one bit happy that you never call
anymore.  We're not paying $25,000 a year for you to enjoy yourselves.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:	</b>But what do you want with us?<p>
<p>
<b>STATS:	</b>Get up!  Here, take these.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:	</b>What are they?<p>
<p>
<b>MOTHER:	</b>We thought we'd make up our own version of your "Gaieties" --
something more acceptable for you to perform here!<p>
<p>
<i>[Some of the SUATF troops return with captive Stanford students. The SUATF
Members distribute scripts to the students held at Hooverpoint on stage. Bad
costumes are distributed as well.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	And if we refuse?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ALUM:	</b>You'll read these scripts or it won't just be the fun that gets
sucked.  <i>[Everyone smiles.]  </i>And that's a threat, you perverts.<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[Everyone scrambles toward the sides of the stage.  Newt gets dragged off.
My Mother comes to the front.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>MOTHER:	</b>And now ladies and gentleman, sons and daughters; the SUATF
theatrical society presents Big Game Gaieties 1995  "People who Go to Cal are
Mean Bad Weenies." And... action!<p>
<p>
<i>[What follows is a "Meta-Gaieties" of sorts, during which cast members hold
scripts and read their lines poorly, reluctant to perform the SUATF
scripts]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>STANFORD PERSON 1:</b>   I am sure glad that I go to Stanford University.
You know why?  Because people who go to Cal are Mean Bad Weenies.<p>
<p>
<b>S.P. 2:</b> 	Not to mention hippies.  Why, look at those two over there.
<i>[Points to two blue-and-gold clad people holding Cal pennants, etc.]</i>
You can tell they go to Cal cause they're wearing blue and gold clothing.  <p>
<p>
<b>S.P.3:	</b>And they are so stupid.  Hey are you guys from Cal?<p>
<p>
<b>CAL PEOPLE:</b>   <i>[Fingers positioned appropriately in cheeks.] </i>
Duh...<p>
<p>
<b>STANFORD PEOPLE:</b><i>   </i>Are you hippies?<p>
<p>
<b>CAL PEOPLE:</b>   Yeah man.<p>
<p>
<b>STANFORD PEOPLE:</b>   Well Jerry Garcia's dead! <i>[point and laugh]</i>
Ha-ha-ha! <i>[then in unison.]</i>   People who go to Cal are Mean Bad Stupid
Hippie Weenies.<p>
<p>
<b>S.P. 1:</b>	Hey, let's sing about it!<p>
<p>
<i>[They line-up into a straight line Chorus.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Song six:<b>  PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES</b><p>
<p>
<b>	CHORUS</b><p>
PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES.<p>
PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES.<p>
<p>
<i>[One by one, different characters step out of the line to speak their
oh-so-witty lines of dialogue. Although they are holding scripts, they can be
in character to some extent.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>POSTMAN:</b>  Hi. I'm a Stanford Post Office Worker. Did you ever notice how
slow the mail is at Stanford? Man is it slow!<p>
<p>
<b>CHORUS:	</b><i>[Laughs.]</i> PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE
	WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<b>HASHER:</b>	I'm a Hasher at Roble Food Service.  Did you ever notice how
bad the food is at Stanford?  Man is it bad!<p>
<p>
<b>CHORUS</b>:	PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:  I'm a Tour Guide at Stanford University.  Did you ever
notice that we call the Coffeehouse the "CoHo" and Memorial Church "MemChu?"
Man do we have some silly abbreviations for things!<p>
<p>
<b>CHORUS</b>:	PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<b>HOOVER TOWER:</b>  I'm Hoover Tower. Did you ever notice how much I resemble
a penis? Man I look like a penis! <i>[Looks back, but the Chorus does not
sing.]</i>  Come on, everybody -- I look like such a penis!  <i>[Still no
singing.</i>]  I mean, am I crazy?  I LOOK LIKE A GODDAMNED PENIS!!!
<i>[Collapses in exhaustion, finally provoking a response.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>CHORUS:</b>  	PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<b>PI PHI:	</b>I am a Pi Phi.  Did you ever notice how ditzy the Sorority girls
are at Stanford?  Man are we ditzy!<p>
<p>
<b>CHORUS:</b>  	PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<b>CORN:</b> 	<i>[Holding hands over head in a point, straight out of a
kindergarten play.] </i> I am the corn that the Indians gave to the Pilgrims at
that first Thanksgiving feast.  The friendly Indians made us feel at home in
our new land.<p>
<p>
<b>CHORUS:</b>	THE FRIENDLY INDIANS MADE US FEEL AT HOME IN OUR NEW LAND!<p>
	AND PEOPLE WHO GO TO CAL ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<b>CAL PEOPLE: </b>  <i>[Singing in big finale style, with chorus in a kickline
behind them.]</i>  WE GO TO CAL AND WE ARE MEAN BAD STUPID HIPPIE WEENIES!<p>
<p>
<i>[End of song, but we're still in the meta-Gaieties, for those keeping score
at home.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>S.P. #32:</b> 	Hey look everybody!  It's our beloved President, Gerhard
Casper!<p>
<p>
<i>[The fake Casper enters, beaming his Teutonic grin.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>FAKE CASPER:</b>   Greetings, my Stanford <i>liebchen</i>!  <i>[Everyone on
stage claps.]</i>  I bet you're wondering why I'm wearing a sweater.  It's
because it will be a cold day in hell when Cal wins Big Game!  Brrr.  <i>[Cast
looks confused.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>S.P. #17:	</b>Gee, President Gerhard Casper, Branner sucks!<p>
<p>
<i>[Jeremy waits for frosh to shut their damn cake-holes, then yells.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Wait a minute!  This is horrible!  Gaieties is supposed to be
funny! <i>[Writers giggle at the irony.]</i> You're ruining it!<p>
<p>
<b>FAKE CASPER:</b>  Don't fret.  Everything will be "All Right Now."<p>
<p>
<i>[Everyone looks to the side for the Band's raucous entrance.  Instead, the
Stanford Orchestra enters, quickly sets down chairs and plays their classical
version of `All Right Now.' Jeremy can't take any more of this.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>JEREMY:</b>	That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more!
<i>[Jeremy pulls a can of spinach out of a pocket, eats some and attacks the
orchestra. Though they stop playing for him, he is quickly restrained by the
many SUATF troops and thrown back in with the other captives.]  </i>Dammit,
when I find out who's behind all this, I'll bite their ears off.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>[At this the real Casper joins the hubbub on stage. He is dressed in the
Emperor's robe from `Return of the Jedi'  (the actual same one) which covers
his whole body. He motions for the orchestra to continue playing. Vamp under
dialogue. He laughs maniacally.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>CASPER:	</b>Bwaaa-ha-ha-ha...  I don't think you'll be munching on
these lobes any time soon. Neither you nor anyone can stop my plans to suck all
the fun out of Stanford! <i>[Tools of suckage are raised.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Holy poo! It's you? I can't believe our own University President
would be behind this villainous plan!<p>
<p>
<b>CASPER:</b>	Then don't. It still won't alter your fate. <i>[To the troops.]
</i> 			Round them up. All of them.<p>
<p>
<i>[The SUATF goons close in around the crowd of Stanford students as if to
say, "We are going to take you somewhere now, OK?" A look of fear passes across
their faces. Will they survive? Will Casper have them pan fried? Will Myra ever
live to see the Draw? Will she end up having to live in Sterling Quad on a
preferred year? Turn the damn page and find out.]</i><p>
<b><i>Scene XII:  Die Ending: With a Vengeance</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<i>[As the SUATF members close around the rest of our heroes, the theme song
from "Wonder Woman" screeches over the loud speakers. The orchestra stops
playing.]</i><p>
<p>
<b>THE NINJA-DOLLIES:</b>	KIIIIIIIYYYYAAAAAAAA!!!<p>
<p>
<i>[The four newly-trained, ex-prisoners explode onto the stage -- flipping and
being otherwise ninja-cool as they do. The freshly-made ninja-dollies
</i><cite>all</cite><i> wear the sacred garb -- dollie outfit, sash with
weapons tucked in them, black socks with the two-toe-feet thing, personalized
headbands, etc. If the characters are still difficult to recognize they can
retain their distinctive accessories.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>*KaNdeE* pops out of the trap door and takes her buffalo-ninja stance. They
fall into wicked-cool formation center stage, reminiscent of the Turtles. All
eyes are on *KaNdeE*.</i> <i>"Wonder Woman" music ends. *KaNdeE* hisses at the
orchestra: they weep and scurry offstage.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>MOTHER:</b>	Who are they?  <p>
<p>
<b>FISHERMAN:</b>   They're Stanford students.  Wacky ones.  We must be
careful.<p>
	<p>
<b>ALUM:</b>	Let's get `em!<p>
<p>
<i>[The SUATF team attacks the Ninjas but are easily repelled by their superior
paramilitary training.  After a well choreographed fight scene there is a heap
of SUATF scripts and dead SUATF troops all around them.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Casper attempts to tip-toe away, but...]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Not so fast, Jimmy Jack.<p>
<p>
<b>CASPER:</b>	<i>[Turns around to face her.]</i> You may have won this battle,
my friends, but <u>we</u> are more powerful than you can possibly imagine.<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Your "we" have just been turned to matzah meal.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	Yeah, let's get him!<p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:	</b>NO! <i>[Stays the crowd.]</i> No way. This one's all mine.
<i>[To Casper.]</i>  It's time to crack open a six-pack of Wh&uuml;pAss.<p>
<p>
<b>CASPER:</b>	Bring it on.<p>
<p>
<i>[*KaNdeE* and Casper face off center stage, with the conscious portion of
the assembled cast cheering around them. They circle warily and stare each
other down. Weird light flash to make it hard to see exactly what's going on.
After a few laps around each other *KaNdeE*</i><b>  </b><i>jumps in on Casper.
She strikes his chest (not really, it's just a play -- you know, acting) and
hits something hard. We hear a crunch and Casper falls back a bit.] </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>*KaNdeE*:</b>	Ow! What you got underneath there?<p>
<p>
<i>[*KaNdeE* yanks off Casper's robe, revealing a pentium processor affixed to
his torso.  It's a huge lit up circuit board that says INTEL on one side and
PROPERTY OF CAL on the other.  Everyone gasps.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>JEREMY:</b>	Wait.  I saw this on a movie once.  It's an implant!  His
mind has been controlled by this techno-bugger... just to be nasty to us.<p>
<p>
<i>[He yanks the circuit board off. Cool computer noises blip away and make Dan
Goldman feel at home.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>CASPER:</b>	<i>[Somewhat confused.]</i>  Oh!  I can finally think for
myself again!  Thank you for releasing me from thirty years of this terrible
weenie curse.<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	He must have been wired by those forces of evil when he taught
at Cal in the sixties.<p>
<p>
<b>MYRA:</b>	But that doesn't explain all those other files we read. Like
Casper wasn't even here when the War of the Row Houses happened.  <p>
<p>
<b>*KaNdeE*:	</b>No, we can't blame Casper for everything. He is but the final
piece in the huge jigsaw puzzle of Cal's master plan of world domination. Cal
has been wreaking havoc everywhere all along.<p>
<p>
<b>JEREMY:</b>	Yeah!  They're the ones who destroyed the Canada center!<p>
<p>
<b>HOBART:</b>	They're the ones who tried to put an end to Big Game week!<p>
<p>
<b>HOOTOW:</b>	They're the ones who made me look like a dick!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>MYRA:</b>	But it's all over. Now Stanford can be the
happy-perky-pippy-fucking-longstockings place it once was!<p>
<p>
<b>CASPER:</b>	Of course!  Stanford should be a place of celebration and
harmony.  Let there be parties and nookie for everyone.<p>
