		  <h2>The Cast </h2>
		  <p><strong>Clea Alsip</strong>  was raised in a two-bedroom house with 12 siblings
    and a dog named Bud (who was missing a leg). She would like to thank all
    her family: mama, Big Daddy, Ethel, Boopsie, Norma-Jean, Trixie, Roro,
    Amber, Brenda-Lee, Peggie-Loo (damnit, I can't remember the rest of
    their names) and of course her wonderful friends (oh my fuglysluts, how
    I love you all)!!!</p>
		  <p> <strong>Jeff Austin</strong>, after stopping out to study the fine art of the Ninja
      throwing star, has returned to Stanford to pursue his degree in
      Calligraphy. He aspires to one day travel deep into the
      Pacific-Northwest to track the rare and elusive phenomenon known as
      Bigfoot. He sends thanks to the cast, staff, and his wife Courtney for
      their love and support!</p>
		  <p><strong>Cullen Averill</strong>, sketchy graduate student getting his
        Ph.D. in Molecular Finance and Computational Penis, has no friends. This
        is his 18th year in Gaieties, loves the cast, and can't wait for next
        year's &quot;fresh batch.&quot; He used to be a professional baseball player - his
        position: left out. All of this might be a joke, except the part of
        having no friends. Sad.</p>
		  <p><strong> Brittiany Broadwater</strong> makes her musical debut with
        Gaieties 2005. After a three month long hiatus apprenticing with Steve
        Irwin (The Crocodile Hunter), Brittiany decided to leave the kangaroos
        and Australian Outback behind for the Jungle that is Gaieties 2005. Her
        latest project, Bring it On 2.5: Bringing It Only Halfway, because We're
        too Lazy to Bring it All the Way, premieres next year.</p>
		  <p><strong>Juliane Caillouette </strong> is proud to
        make an appearance in Gaieties before fleeing to Italy for the rest of
        forever. In honor of her escape, she would like to take a moment to
        teach the audience some important Italian words: allupato adj. hungry
        for sex; puttaniere m. whoremonger; bocchino v.t. to perform fellatio;
        cosina veloce (una) f. a quickie; Fissa Eccellente (lit. &quot;SUPER PUSSY&quot;)
        best seniors ever.</p>
	    <p><strong>Emily Davis</strong>  was born in a small Amish
        community. Her life was typical (milking cows, dating cows) until a
        traveling circus came to town and she discovered her incredible
        fire-eating abilities. She joined the circus traveling the world and
        engaging in love triangles with the lion tamer and the bearded lady. She
        is planning on majoring in molecular physocist embryology with a minor
        in art history.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="quarter">
	    <p><strong>Katie Fogelsong</strong> stared as the only female hobbit in the midget porn Whore of the Rings, when she was only five years old. This film launched her career and she proceeded to film commercials as the memorable Crest kid. She practices kabbalah and likes the smell of Irish Spring Icy Blast soap.</p>
	    <p><strong>Olivia Harewood</strong>  is a
          covert CIA operative who...oh no wait,...crap.....ummmm, okay so Olivia
          was raised on a latex farm....in Greece. Yes, they do exist, you
          obviously just don't know anything about Greece. (If you are from Greece
          or have any suspicions about Olivia's identity, please voice them to her
          after the show...come alone and unarmed.)</p>
	    <p><strong>Kasey Hurlbutt</strong>, after being born in
        a straw hut on Easter Island, moved to Romania at the age of 3 where she
        began training to be an Olympic gymnast with coach Gregorio
        Blemhovanohavhavhav. But after an unfortunate fall off the balance beam
        during a double front layout she ruptured her spleen and was forced to
        give up her dream forever. After spending 10 years in the circus as the
        &quot;Spleenless Trapezewoman&quot; she is happy to join the Gaieties family.</p>
		  <p><strong>Annie Jonas</strong>  was born a
        poor black child. After years of confusion and soul-searching — and a
        minor stint as a professional midget-catcher — she found her niche in
        the fine art of emu dress-making. In the evenings she delights in
        somersaulting through other people's backyards and playing naked
        charades with her imaginary friend Monsieur Tapayuki.</p>
		  <p><strong>Cori Nicole Marquis</strong> explains, &quot;I like big butts, and I cannot
        lie.&quot; There you have it, straight from the be'boppin' mouth of National
        All-Star Thug champion, Haubout Imgunnaeatyurmamma, formerly known as
        Cori Nicole Marquis. As national champion, Haubout now gets &quot;crunk&quot;
        regularly when she's not catchin' it on the flipside with her
        homedoggies. &quot;Don't be trippin', Beast. You want my goobies.&quot; Thug4life!</p>
		  <p><strong>Melquiades Olivares</strong>, North Philadelphia! born
        and raised, on the playground I used to spend most of my days, chillin
        out, relaxin and acting all cool and playing some b-ball outside of my
        school. When his mother disowned him for being obscenely handsome,
        traumatized, Mel went to California where there are apparently support
        groups for this (Gaieties is not one of them). He is writing a musical
        about it.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="quarter"><p><strong>Amanda Otte</strong> was born on Planet Proserpine
        (don't get me started) and was beamed to Earth after parading naked in a
        nursery school classroom. She was accepted to Stanford after performing
        many sexual favors and suspects she was cast as her character because
        somebody found out the alias she uses when visiting upper-level
        administrators. She would like to thank Nicole Schuetz for being so well
        endowed.</p>
		  <p><strong>Jason Richman</strong> first achieved fame as
        the winner of the Edible Undies Eating Contest, but has since moved on
        to less refined achievements such as karaoke singing the Queen of the
        Night's aria in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and being Jewish. But Jason tops
        himself with his performance this evening in Gaieties.</p>
		  <p><strong>Aaron Rosekind</strong>, after
        sneezing himself into existence about a week ago, invented another word
        for synonym and started Atheism (a non-prophet organization). Famous at
        rehearsals for having to break into song because he can never find the
        key, Aaron would like to remind everyone out there that condoms should
        be used on every conceivable occasion.</p>
		  <p><strong>Sammie Sachs</strong> started out as a performing
        underwater basket weaver at the tender age of twelve years old, gaining
        acclaim from all corners of the globe. However, by the age of fifteen,
        she became restless and aspired to reach the fame and glory of her idol,
        Mr. Michael Jackson. *edit* *edit* *edit* She actually paid us off to
        get into Gaieties. Just try to ignore her.</p>
		  <p><strong> Peter Shannon</strong>, after leaving the USC
        film school, first attempted a feature-length motion picture, &quot;Stanford
        Sluts II: Full Moon with Farm Animals&quot; and grossed 425.7 million Yen in
        the Japanese Anime film market. He now returns for a cameo appearance in
        the production that originally inspired his libido-driven desire to direct. </p>
		  <p><strong>Matt Steinecker</strong>  was born Jesus Y. Gonzales, a poor Hispanic child in the slums of Colombia, sometime in the early 80s. He found gainful employment as a coke mule, and quickly rose to the top of the national drug trade, gaining a reputation as the &quot;Doogie Howser&quot; of Cocaine. After falling victim to an FBI sting, he worked out a plea bargain and was given a new name, a new face, and admission to Stanford University.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="quarter">
		  <p><strong>Thackerey Thunderpants</strong>, of Preparation
        H fame, is sadly ending his Gaieties career. He owes much to the focus
        and dedication of Superpussy, the coffee bitch, the Twindians, his
        immigrant family, and everyone who helped with his rewarding producing
        days. Next year he hopes to wrestle professionally and he wants to
        become famous for his acting, like the Olsen twins.</p>
		  <p><strong>Stefan Vraspir</strong> arrived in the world after
        the stork bearing the young Stefan was blown off course in a freak
        windstorm, dropping him on a small island in the South Pacific. The
        islanders, thinking him a god who had appeared in the night, worshipped
        him and made sacrifices of their finest virgins. Why did he leave?
        &quot;Gaieties is better than an island full of beautiful virgins.&quot;</p>
		  <p><strong>Dina Wallin</strong>, in her fourth
        Gaieties, keeps it real, hardcore. Booze, booze, booze, focus bowl,
        JEFF, baseball, business meeting, focus bowl, booze, booze. Greg,
        Cullen, and Thackerey Thunderpants. Booze. Booze.
        She's a dyke, you're a dyke, get out of my museum! Booze, booze, focus
        bowl, booze. Booze, booze, focus bowl on the roof, naked ocean, booze.
        KISS MY GALAXY.</p>
		  <p><strong>Greg Worswick</strong>  has been marooned on an
          island in the South Pacific since Oceanic Air flight 815 tore apart in
          mid-air and crashed. The survivors, Greg included, were forced to find
          inner strength they never knew they had during the harrowing several
          weeks following the crash, but they discovered that the island held many
          secrets, including the intense howls of a mysterious creature stalking
          the jungle, a ruthless wild boar, an enigmatic group known only as &quot;The
          Others,&quot; and...a hatch.</p>
