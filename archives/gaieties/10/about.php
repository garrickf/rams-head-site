        <h3>About Gaieties</h3>
        <p>
        The most well-known and beloved production on campus, Gaieties is a student-written, student-produced, student directed, politically incorrect, hilariously over-the-top musical extravaganza.  The show is the biggest and most outrageous theatrical event at Stanford. Performed the week of Big Game, Gaieties packs Mem Aud with crowds of rowdy Cal-hating students eager to "Beat Cal!"  Follow the adventures of our group of heroic freshmen as they fight to save Stanford from the devilish advances of Cal.  Gaieties: a MUST-ATTEND event for all Stanford students!
