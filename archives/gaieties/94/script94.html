<p>1.1: &quot;Tour de Force&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>Forrest:</b> Hi! My name is Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump. I would like
to welcome you all to Big Game Gaieties 1994. Heard it's supposed to be a real good show.
It's got lots of people in it. Lots of people, well that means there are lots of shoes.
You got to have real comfortable shoes to be in a big show such as this one. You need
dancing shoes, and acting shoes, and singing shoes, too. Well My Mama always used to say:
Shut the hell up, Forrest. So I'm gonna do that now. Oh here comes the tour guide. He's a
nice guy.</p>

<p><i>TOUR GUIDE and Group come down the aisle of Mem Aud. The Tour Guide is pointing out
some of Stanford's most illustrious sights. </i></p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> And on your left we have the Claw, named after Henry James Claw,
Class of `42. We're walking, we're walking. On the right you have Old Union, named after
Henry James Union, class of `42. We're walking. We're walking. On the left is the [<i>Goofy
finger quotes on each one</i>] &quot;&quot;CoHo&quot;, &quot;Flo-Mo&quot;, &quot;the
Row&quot;, &quot;Soto&quot;, and look there's &quot;Gobo&quot; from Fraggle Rock! Please
don't step on the doozers. [<i>The group ascends the stairs in front of red</i> ] On the
left we have Meyer. On the right, the Dish. On the left, Canada. On the right Mexico. Now
that we're halfway through our tour, we have time for a few questions. Yes. Why look, it's
Janice from Head of the Class!</p>

<p><b>Janice: </b>On <u>my</u> show, I was head of the class. I'm worried about whether I
still will be at Stanford. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide</b>: Well, 93 percent of the grades given out here are A's and B's. 98
percent of your body is water. You do the math. Yes, Danny Pintauro, aka Jonathan from
Who's the Boss? </p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> On <u>my</u> show, Tony Danza was the boss. Who's the boss at Stanford?</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide: </b>Well, we let Casper think he's in charge, but I'd put my money on
the cheery lady in the bookstore photo department. She's the real sheriff in town. Yes,
why look, it's Fred Savage from the Wonder Years!</p>

<p><b>Fred VO:</b> [<i>Fred walks downstage and gazes thoughtfully into nowhere while his
theme song begins--What would you do if I sang out of tune...</i>]<i> </i>There I was,
remembering those wonderful years of growing up, of loving Winnie...<i> </i>too bad she
was slammed by Stanford and ended up at Cal. I couldn't help but ask, will my years at
Stanford be as wonderful?</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> [<i>s/he's been looking around for the voice.</i>] I <u>love</u>
when he does that!<i> </i>Good question, Fred. Stanford is wonderful. It's a cultural
mosaic, a patchwork quilt, a rainbow of fruit flavors. And when we think of our alma
mater, make sure you think of the person that made it all possible... [<i>Shameless cue.
The TOUR GUIDE and GROUP exit as the curtain rises to reveal White Plaza, many people
whizzing back and forth on bikes, rollerblades, à pied, etc.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Song 1: Leland, We're Glad You Croaked</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p>ALL: </b>Stanford life is perfect, from Roble to Manzanita<br>
  The tall palm trees, at Mirrielees, and old Lake Lagunita<br>
  But Stanford's more than beauty, more than academic joy <br>
  Stanford life rests on the death of a cute, adorable, little boy.<br>
  </p>
  <p>So when you think of Stanford, think deeper, think harder<br>
  Think of Leland Stanford Junior, our Dear Old Martyr.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Where would we be if we hadn't lost our little pal?<br>
  We'd all be wearing blue and gold and serving time at Cal.<br>
  Without your bloody painful death, our lives would be a joke<br>
  Leland Stanford Junior - we're really glad you croaked.<br>
  Croaked, croaked, croaked.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Without the University, good ol' Casper'd have no job<br>
  There wouldn't be a Chu named Mem, or a Dorm named Bob<br>
  No IM teams, primal screams, Flicks with Dolby sound<br>
  Cheesy traditions, they'd be no more, thank god you're underground .<br>
  Ground, ground, ground.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<i>During a vamp, the TOUR GUIDE and GROUP reenter </i>]</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b><i> </i>The story goes that in 1884 little Leland Stanford Junior, a
strapping young youth with a hankering to learn, came down with a nasty case of typhoid
fever. So nasty, that little Leland kicked the proverbial bucket. So, Jane and Leland
decided to build a University in memory of their beloved son. It's been said that they
made the roofs red so that little Leland could look down from his &quot;little study break
in the sky&quot; and see his little university. And although it's too bad the little tyke
had to<i>[goofy finger quotes] </i>&quot;croak&quot;, if he hadn't, we wouldn't have
Stanford University. </p>

<p>[<i>back to song</i> ]</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p>ALL: </b>If Leland hadn't bought the Farm,<br>
  His parents would have sold the Farm,<br>
  And all the students on the Farm<br>
  Would be devoid of knowledge<br>
  </p>
  <p>But Leland - that unlucky boy,<br>
  Went and caught himself typhoid<br>
  Jane and Leland were annoyed<br>
  And built themselves a college<br>
  </p>
  <p>We're really glad, dear Leland, typhoid racked your little bod,<br>
  If it hadn't, there'd be no Gaieties, no Full Moon on the Quad.<br>
  In fact we'd be as down and out as those Cal Berkeley folks<br>
  Leland Stanford Junior--we're awfully glad you croaked!<br>
  Croaked, croaked, croaked!<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>End of song. </i></p>

<p><b>Tour Guide: </b>This time of year, people here at Stanford as well as people across
the bay at Stanford's arch rival the University of California at Berkeley, are busily
preparing for the Big Game. </p>

<p><i>A band of 4 Cal thugs come bursting on stage, holding the tour group hostage.</i></p>

<p><b>Thug #1: </b>All right, the party's over.</p>

<p><b>Thug #2: </b>Yeah, like, nobody move. Now, give us the Axe!</p>

<p><i>a pregnant pause</i></p>

<p><b>Tourist: </b>Wait a minute, don't you guys have the axe this year?</p>

<p><b>Thug #1: </b>Uh... we do?</p>

<p><b>Thug #2: </b>What do you mean, dude?</p>

<p><b>Thug #3: </b>Huh-huh. We'd have to be pretty stupid to come all the way down here to
steal an axe we already have.</p>

<p><i>[Lights up on Forrest in the juliet]</i></p>

<p><b>Gump: </b>My Momma used to always say: Stupid is as Berkeley does.</p>

<p><i>[Lights down on Forrest, eating choc-lates]</i></p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b>You guys. Cal has the axe. They narrowly edged out Stanford at the
last Big Game.</p>

<p><b>Thug #2: </b>Dude. Cal has it?!!</p>

<p><b>Thug #3: </b>Cal has it!!!</p>

<p><b>Thug #1: </b>Let's go steal it. And bring it back to Berkeley.</p>

<p><i>[Thugs run off stage]</i></p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b>Alright tour group. Although an unexpected interruption, those are
what we at Stanford call &quot;Weenies.&quot; Moving on in our tour, up ahead you will
see-</p>

<p><i>Then we hear the General Lee horn-- &quot;na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na&quot;
from offstage, after which we see a SURE escort cart enter from stage left, parting the
crowd. The cart says &quot;SURE&quot;, of course, but it is decorated with fuzzy dice and
racing stripes. Behind the wheel is SAM, wearing a leather jacket, aviator glasses, and a
scarf draped daintily around his neck. He is the epitome of the Big Man on Campus. When
the cart screeches to a halt, the crowd gathers around, fawning over the cart and its
preening driver.</i> </p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> Oh look! It's Sam &quot;the Schmooze&quot; Cleveland, our favorite
SURE escort driver. Hey Sam, come over here and say hi to my tourgroup!</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Hi, tourgroup. How do you all like my new set of wheels. Just got it souped
up down at the Campus Bike Shop by my pal Cooter. [<i>chorus of oohs and aahs. He points
to Fred </i>] If any of you lovely ladies ever want a ride, just call 5-SURE. Here's my
card.</p>

<p><b>Fred: </b>SURE escort drivers give rides to guys too, right?</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Drop dead Fred. Heeeyyyyy, aren't you that Doogie Howser kid?</p>

<p><b>Fred: </b>Yeah, right. [<i>in that oh-so-Wonder-Years-way</i> ]</p>

<p><b>Joe Schmoe:</b> Sam &quot;the Schmooze!&quot; We've heard all about you. I'd give
anything to be a fly on the wall of your dorm room. You're a legend!</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Nope, I'm a real person.</p>

<p><b>Liz Schmiz: </b>Is it true that you initiated 117 frosh women at Full Moon on the
Quad?</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>If you only count this year.</p>

<p><b>Tourist: </b>And you date more than anyone else on campus! Is it true that you took
different women to the 7 AND 10:00 Flicks?</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Yeah, but it's not as great as it sounds. I'm tired of dating around. You
can only have so many conversations with Pi Phis majoring in Comm. They don't know that
many words. Yep. I'm fixin' to become a one-woman man.</p>

<p><b>Paul: </b>Kinda like Rupaul?</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Oh kayyyy. </p>

<p><b>Tour Guide: </b>Well, good luck, Sam. If you want a hot tip, rumor has it there's
many intelligent woman to be found in the Coffee House....[<i>to group</i> ] the &quot;Co
Ho&quot;. See ya Sam. [<i>Starts talking to the tour group again. Sam walks upstage to
cart,</i>] We're walking, we're walking....<i> </i>On your left, &quot;Mem Aud,&quot; on
your right, &quot;Mem Chu.&quot; On the left, the Daily, on the right, the Review. In the
rear is SCBN, Stanford's own television station. [<i>someone raises her hand</i> ] Yes?</p>

<p><b>Soleil Moon Frye: </b>Um, I've been trying to watch SCBN, but there's never anything
on.</p>

<p><b>Tourguide:</b> That's why it's called the Imagination Station. Just sit back and
imagine....[<i>Enter Holly, a mysterious genius with a penchant for robes.</i> ] Hey,
Holly Lazlofeld! What's happening?</p>

<p><b>Holly: </b>Hello, Mr. Tourguide. I'm kind of in a hurry. I need more foamcore for my
time machine, and the House of Foam closes in fifteen minutes!</p>

<p><b>Tourguide:</b> Still working on that &quot;time machine&quot;, huh? </p>

<p><b>Holly:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>Tourguide: </b>Gonna graduate this year?</p>

<p><b>Holly: </b>Maybe next year. Seven's my lucky number. See you later. Or perhaps
earlier...</p>

<p><b>Tourguide:</b> [<i>walking off stage </i>]<i> </i>Next, we'll be heading for
Tresidder. There's the &quot;CoPo,&quot; &quot;FroYo,&quot; some &quot;profros,&quot; and
even &quot;KoKo&quot; the magical talking chimp.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Hmmmm. Intelligent women at the Co-Ho, eh? [<i>The sun sets behind him and
a big ol' fan blows his scarf. He gets out and stands alone, arms akimbo.</i>] Y'know,
maybe that's a good idea. I keep looking for the right woman, but the ones I always find
are shallow, egotistical, and self-centered. I'm much too good for them. Why can't I find
my perfect woman, my true solemate. I know she's somewhere out there, beneath the pale
moonlight. Stay alive no matter what occurs. I will find you! [<i>Sam is majestically
backlit as Last of the Mohicans theme plays in the background.</i>]</p>

<p><i>End of scene </i></p>

<p><b>1.2: &quot;Coffee House Rock&quot;</b></p>

<p><i>Lights up- Reveal a motley set. The Co-Ho. Lighting is good in some areas, awful in
others. The set is made up of many coffeehouse &quot;levels.&quot; Above the counter is
some of that random coffeehouse decor, that we've all come to know and love, like a giant
tootsie roll. There is a skeleton in the corner The line runs off stage, and all the
employees except for one frantic anemic male are all standing behind the counter doing
nothing. Sign of the different foods that are served including: The CoHo Dwarf Talisman
sandwich, Dirt, Fried Arrillaga. It is currently Open Mike night, and on stage are two
dancing women in Mariachi dresses and one at the mike.</i></p>

<p><b>Marita: </b>So in conclusion, please come and join us next Thursday night for Ballet
Folklorico's annual mariachi and skeet shooting exhibition. [<i> The dancing women pull
goggles down over their braids and begin shooting to the beat of the music</i> ]</p>

<p><b>Dancer 1: </b>Pull! [<i>She launches the skeet as dancer 2 fires the rifle </i>]</p>

<p><b>EmCee: </b>[<i>She's a mime, albeit not a very good one. She walks a dog, pulls a
rope, either with actual props or explaining what she is doing. Basically, she just likes
to wear the funny whiteface.</i>]<i> </i>For those of you who just strolled in, welcome to
the CoHo's Open Mike Night. Remember, every Wednesday is Nietzche Night, so come out to
celebrate nihilism. We will continue in just a few minutes. [<i>Art goes up there and just
sits</i> ]</p>

<p><b>Employee: </b>CoHo Dwarf Talisman Sandwich! Who ordered the--</p>

<p><b>Hank: </b>Right here. Thanks.</p>

<p><i>The Coffee Talk woman and friend approaches the counter.</i></p>

<p><b>Linda Richmond:</b>I'll have a double mocha mint. </p>

<p><b>Lonnie:</b> Hey, Linda!</p>

<p><b>Linda: </b>Loawnnie! How are you! Give me a coawl! 555-4444, we'll have coawffee,
we'll toawk about doawgs and doawters! [<i>She goes to sit down with her big hair</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Holly Lazlofeld approaches the counter.</i></p>

<p><b>Employee: </b>What can I get you?</p>

<p><b>Holly: </b>I'll have another of those crusty scones.</p>

<p><b>Employee: </b>I can't believe how many of those things you eat!</p>

<p><b>Holly: </b>Oh I don't eat them. I'm using them to build...something.</p>

<p><i>Holly moves on. Enter Lydia. She is clever, an intellectual of sorts, but a touch
wackée. </i></p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Hi, can I have the Humanities Humdinger?</p>

<p><b>Sneering Billy Idol Counter Girl: </b>Hey, Lydia. Sure... whatever. [<i>Annoyingly
slow.</i>] With Kennel Slaw or the Condaleeza Rice Pilaf?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Surprise me.</p>

<p><b>SBIC Girl: </b>Boo!</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Aaaah!</p>

<p><b>SBIC Girl:</b> Now go. Go pay. Go on, get out of here! Shoo!</p>

<p><i>Lydia slaps down a ten dollar bill and sits down next to Sidekick Myra.</i></p>

<p><b>Myra</b> Hey, Lydia. How was your Kazoo lesson?</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Fine, but my teacher's a Mendicant and keeps trying to get me to learn
Brown-Eyed Girl. If I hear it one more time, I'm cracking skulls!</p>

<p><i>Phil approahes.</i></p>

<p><b>Phil: </b>Hey, Lydia.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Buzz off creep!</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Jeez Lydia. Relax. Don't yell at Phil, he only has two lines in the show.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> Yeah, so be nice to me. [<i>Phil, having used up his quota, walks
dejectedly offstage.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Some guys.</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Lydia, it's no wonder you can't keep a steady boyfriend. Look at how you
treated Phil.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>It's not me that's the problem. It's the guys. There's only one thing on
their minds.</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Sex, Lydia?</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Uh, not right now, Myra, I've got problems.</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Come on. You're still angry because that grad student you were seeing
turned out to be a jerk and dumped you. </p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>What? I'm over that. I'm not the least bit angry at that
low-down-pumped-up-good-for-nothing-weasel-spawn-I-hope-he dies. [<i>said as politely as
possible </i>]</p>

<p><i>There is mild applause for Art, who has completed his two minutes of silence.</i></p>

<p><b>Emcee: </b>All right everyone, next up, the best groomed man on public television,
Bob, &quot;The Flash&quot; Ross! [<i>Bob morphs on stage. The crowd is awed. </i>]</p>

<p><b>Bob: </b>Of course we start with happy trees. Good. Now add another happy tree.
Great. (<i>The crowd grows restless</i>) Now add that stalker from Melrose Place, the eyes
peeping through the shower wall. Who's that naked in there? Looks like Heather Locklear to
me. Yes, that's perfect. <i>(Turns toward the audience)</i> Here's the finished product. (<i>Holds
up a disturbing abstract painting.)</i> </p>

<p><b>Myra </b>Lydia, you should go up there. You could do better than that guy.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>He's got his own show, Myra.</p>

<p><b>Myra</b> So does Barney, and he's a fucking moron.</p>

<p><b>EmCee: </b>While we wait for our next act, I will ooh and ahh you with extraordinary
mimery! [<i>She does some awful miming. </i>]</p>

<p><b>Myra:</b> Look, Lydia, the problem is your att-i-tude, girlfriend! You've got to
free your mind... You've got to say to yourself: &quot;The next guy that walks in the door
-- he just might be the one for me!&quot;</p>

<p><i>Sam enters and poses as he is majesticly backlit. All women, except for Lydia and
Myra, immediately react-- faint, jump up and fawn, etc. </i></p>

<p><b>Woman 1: </b>He's so dreamy!! </p>

<p><b>Woman 2: </b>Yeah, just like Eric Estrada! <i>(The other women all sigh in
agreement)</i></p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Look at that jerk. Who does he think he is anyway? </p>

<p><b>Myra</b> That's Sam Cleveland. There isn't a woman on campus who wouldn't kill to go
out with him. Lydia, don't look now, but he's staring at you. </p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><i>Lydia turns around and sees Sam. He has noticed her 'cause she's the only woman in
the place who didn't notice him, and so he finds her attractive. How's that for
motivation? </i></p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Hey, Sam. Come here.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Hey. Michelle, right? I mean, Myrna. Mel. Maureen.</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Myra.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Riiiiiiiight. So who's this? </p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Buzz off, creep.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Oooh, feisty.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Look Sal. Stu. Steve. </p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Sam.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Riiiight. Look, I don't need you and I don't want you. Why don't you go
somewhere where you're wanted. I hear the Women's Self-Defense class needs a practice
dummy.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Look, don't flatter yourself, um-</p>

<p><b>Lydia. -</b>Lydia-</p>

<p><b>Sam: -</b>Lydia. I'm just here to get something to drink. What do they have?</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Coffee. </p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>I knew that.</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>My, you two seem to be hitting it off quite well. Why don't I get you that
coffee, Sam? <i>[Leaving] </i>What do you want in it?</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>A straw?</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Uugh. I'm getting out of here.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Oh come on, Lydia, relax. You're looking for someone. I'm looking for
someone. Maybe we're looking for the same people, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Look let's get something straight... <i>[Music starts] </i>We both might
be lonely and we both might need someone <i>[Music] </i>But that doesn't mean I need <i>you...</i>
</p>

<p><b>Song #2: I Don't Need You</b></p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Yeah. You could say that Lydia finally came to her senses.</p>

  <b><p>Consultant:</b> Women never found me attractive, I was a lonely guy,<br>
  The only menage I could ever find was Me, Myself, and I.<br>
  Whenever I serenade a girl, she screams until I stop,<br>
  And the closest I can to copping a feel, was feeling up a cop.<br>
  </p>
  <p>So when I got out of jail, after posting my bail,<br>
  I needed a brand-new plan.<br>
  So I souped up the look of my Powerbook<br>
  And became a brand-new man!<br>
  </p>
  <p>Now my weekend nights are quite a sight<br>
  With my nice `n easy Mac<br>
  I never fail, cause E-Mail<br>
  Is the ultimate aphrodisiac....<br>
  </p>
  <p>The girls all tove touching my keyboard<br>
  Playing with my option key<br>
  It's the silicon that really turns them on<br>
  To my expandable memory.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Sure they say my disk is floppy<br>
  But that's okay by me,<br>
  Cause there's no complaining when the evening is waning<br>
  And my hard drive's as hard as they want it to be.<br>

  Or an a cappella singer,<br>
  When you need some info, on a sweetie or nympho,<br>
  You just gotta kow how to finger<br>

<p><i>End of scene.</i></p>

<p><b>1.7: &quot;Fevah All Through the Night...&quot;</b></p>

<p><i>Curtain opens. Whoa, what a crazy setting we've stumbled upon. It's almost as if
we've been hurled back to 1884. Oh, we have. It's a horse farm with the requisite barn,
hay bales, scarecrow, hen coop. On one side of the stage, or as part of the backdrop, is a
construction billboard that says: &quot;Future site of PALO ALTO-- Boring Yuppie Suburb of
Tomorrow! Construction begins 1885.&quot; There is smoke everywhere. Sam and Lydia are
sprawled on the stage where they have been thrown by the landing; Gordy and the SURE cart
are nowhere to be found. The Clock Tower is figuring prominently in the background. TOUR
GUIDE enters, with GROUP. They are anachronisms. </i></p>

<p><b>Tour guide:</b> Continuing our tour of Stanford, we find ourselves thrown back in
the past. This is the year 1884. Behind me is the Stanford Family Farm, full of cows,
chickens, and lovable country bumpkins; a place where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
and the skies are not cloudy all day. In the distance behind me, we see the Stanfords'
lovely ranch-style home. To the left we see the Famed Red Barn, to the right, the
audience. Everybody wave! [<i>they all wave, a few even take photos.</i>] Does anyone have
any questions?</p>

<p><b>Parent #1:</b> Will we get to meet the Stanfords?</p>

<p><b>Tour guide:</b> Unfortunately, little Leland has come down with a nasty case of
Typhoid fever, and is very near his final hour. His mother Jane is busy caring for him day
and night, because they just can't get a convenient appointment at Cowell. </p>

<p><b>Parent #2:</b> Where is Mr. Stanford?</p>

<p><b>Tour guide:</b> [<i>putting appropriate words and phrases in physical quotes</i> ]
He's down at the Hoot `n Holler Saloon &quot;tanking up&quot; with the fellas. Later, he's
&quot;fixin'&quot; on heading down to Emma Lou's Pleasure Parlor to get him a slice of
that &quot;sweet potato pie&quot;. If the missus finds out, she's gonna &quot;wup him
plenty.&quot; Any other questions? [<i>they are walking offstage</i> ]</p>

<p><b>Parent #3:</b> [<i>these are the last lines heard from the tour group as they exit</i>
] What exactly are we doing in 1884? </p>

<p><b>Parent #4:</b> Yeah, how did we manage to transcend the space-time continuum?</p>

<p><b>Parent #5:</b> And what the hell does a Hoover Fellow <i>do </i>anyway?</p>

<p><i>Sam and Lydia are regaining consciousness</i>.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Oooooh. What the hell happened? What is this place? Where in God's name
have you brought us? What have you done? </p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Let's not panic. [<i>He pulls a comb and mirror from his back pocket and
spiffs himself up.</i>] We've been thrown from the SURE cart. We probably just blacked
out. Farm. Dirt. Animals. Maybe this is Synergy.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Look!</p>

<p><i>We get our first real taste of the olden days now as many people begin bustling
across the stage. Picture &quot;Oklahoma&quot; on the way to the fair. Women in hoop
skirts with baskets, men in britches. Sam and Lydia stand off to side, befuddled. Leland
Stanford Senior stumbles on stage with a bottle of moonshine. Jane enters from opposite
side</i>.</p>

<p><b>Jane Stanford:</b> Leland Stanford Senior! Where have you been? I been looking all
over fer ye.</p>

<p><b>Stanford:</b> [<i>drinking, but trying to hide it from her. The jug has two big X's
on it, like in cartoons.</i>] Uh...I's been working, honey. I been workin' on the
railroad. </p>

<p><b>Jane:</b> All the live long day? You can't fool me! While I been taking care o'
Leland junior all day, you been down at the Hoot `n Holler again.</p>

<p><b>Stanford:</b> Well... I... Well... I...</p>

<p><b>Jane:</b> Gimme the hooch. [<i>he gives it to her </i>] Well, now I cain't find
little Leland junior either. He's not supposed to leave his bed, but he keeps a-runnin'
off on me. Now you better come help me look, or I'll tan that hide of yers. </p>

<p><b>Stanford:</b> [<i>whipped </i>] Yes'm....But I was supposed to go shootin' today,
with Billy Branner. </p>

<p><b>Jane: </b>Billy Branner? Why, he couldn't shoot molasses going up a hill in January.</p>

<p><b>Stanford: </b>Aw, yur right. Branner sucks! [<i>They exit. The auditorium is so
quiet, you could hear a pin drop.</i> ]</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Did you see that? Where are we? <u>When</u> are we? </p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> [<i>realizing what has happened </i>] Uh-oh. Well, you see... my SURE cart
has just been equipped with a state of the art time machine. We must have been going too
fast....</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>You transported us back to the 1880's? Who do you think you are....Time
Cop? </p>

<p><i>Unnoticed, Leland comes out from behind his favorite hay bale. Sam and Lydia notice.
He is dragging a giant teddy and has a stick with a red handkerchief tied on it.
Run-run-run-a-runaway. He is as cute as the dickens:</i><cite>Charles</cite><i> Dickens.
He sits on the edge of the stage and plays with his bear.</i></p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> Oh Teddy, I'm ever so tired. My red blood cells and my lymphocytes
aren't capable of withstanding the merciless onslaught of mean ol' Mr. Typhoid, least
that's what Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman says. [<i>He coughs enough to toss up a lung.</i>]
But I'm not going back to bed no matter what Ma says.</p>

<p><i>Sam begins to approach Leland. Lydia holds him back.</i></p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> [<i>whispering </i>] Don't!</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Didn't you see <u>Back to the Future</u>? Any interactions we have with
people in the past could have serious repercussions in the present, which is now the
future because we're in the past which is now the present.</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> We could really screw things up. Worse than Eurodisney. Trust me. </p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> How bad could it be? <u>Back to the Future</u> was just a movie. [<i>sarcastic
</i>] What, is Huey Lewis going to start singing now-- oh god, that is scary.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> See what I mean? This is just great. I'm stuck over 100 years in the past
with a man I can't stand!</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Well, You're no Miss Congeniality yourself.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>At least I'm not scamming on the locals. I saw you checking out little
miss Laura Ingalls. [<i>Laura smiles and waves girlishly</i> .]</p>

<p><b>Charles: </b>[<i>standing aside with Caroline</i> ] Oh look. My little half pint's
gettin' to be a full gallon! [<i>They all leave. Ma and pa are teary-eyed. </i>]</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Look, I'm not like that anymore. But why shold I care if you believe it.
Let's go find the cart and get out of here. [<i>they start to leave </i>] I think if I hit
8.8 miles per hour again...Look on the bright side of things, at least that Cal nerd Gordy
hasn't even been born yet. </p>

<p><i>They exit. From a haybale, Gordy appears. He is looking ragged.</i></p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Oooohhhh, my head... That's a pain that's gonna linger, I must say. [<i>sneezes
three times in rapid succession</i>] And my hayfever is acting up again, too... [<i>straightens
his glasses, then spots Leland and approaches</i>] Hey kid, you lost too? </p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> [<i>proudly </i>] No, I ran away on accounta I have Typhoid Fever. [<i>Coughs
in Gordy's face.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Oh, I have something that might help. [<i>pulls various medications out
of his pockets</i>] Hmm... let's see...Inhaler... Seldane... Claritin... Prednisone...
here kid, try some Sudafed<sup>(TM)</sup>. [<i>He wrassles with the child-proof top.
Finally gives it to Leland, who pops off lid and chugs the whole bottle.</i>]
Wwwwoooowwww! Damn, kid. Careful!</p>

<p>[<i>Leland goes to sit down and let the drug take effect</i>] </p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Listen, kid, I've gotta see if my ride is still here. See you later,
alligator. [<i>Sneezes as he exits.</i>] There they go! Lydiaaaa... wait for meeeee... [<i>shortly
after he exits, there is a bright flash of light and time travel noises.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> [<i>getting up</i>] Gee! I feel ever so much better! [<i>thumps on chest
</i>] No more coughing, sniffling, sneezing, aching, stuffy head, or fever! [<i>The olden

<p><b>Sam:</b> [<i>exasperated </i>] But, Dean Montoya, you don't work at an amusement
park! You're the Dean of Admissions at Stanford University!</p>

<p><b>Montoya:</b> University? The only University around these parts is the University of
California at Berkeley, the home of the mighty Golden Bears. I could never work at such a
learned and esteemed institution as that. I just sell tickets at this amusement park. But
I love serving the many Berkeley students that visit Le-land. [<i>Gestures to the teaming

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Holy cow! It's Myra. [<i>Runs over and grabs Myra out of the group.</i> <i>Not
only is Myra a Weenie, but she's a sorority girl too.</i>] </p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Dude. Who the hell are you?</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Myra--it's me, Lydia. Your best friend?! Your roommate?! The one who sits
next to you the Co-ho?!?!?!</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Duuude. Like, you've got the wrong babe. I've never seen you before. You
look so, um, different from the rest of us. [<i>Crowd assents</i>.] You obviously don't go
to Cal.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Of course not! I go to Stanford, and so do you.</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>[<i>to crowd</i> ] Ohmigod! She is so full-on psycho!</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Oh Myra. What have they done to you? Not only have you defected to
Berkeley, but judging from your numerous scrunchies, you've joined a sorority too.</p>

<p><b>Montoya: </b>[<i>nervously stepping forward</i> ] A-hem. Excuse me....Things seem to
be getting a little heated here. Why don't you kids just give me 57.60 for two all-day
passes. Otherwise, I'm going to have to call security.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Dammit, Jim-- you're a dean, not a carnival employee! Snap out of it!
Just SNAP-OUT-OF-IT!!! [<i>she grabs him by the shoulders and starts shaking him madly.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Montoya:</b> [<i>panicked, crying for help</i> ] Security! Help! Boris! Herculo!

<p><i>Cal goons pry Lydia off. They also grab Sam.</i></p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Grandpa Munster?</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> I'm 800 years old!</p>

<p><b>Goon #2:</b> [<i>aside, to Sam and Lydia</i> ] He's really only 126. His birthday
was yesterday.</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> Best birthday I've had all year. Boris gave me this cute little kitten [<i>holds
up turkey </i>] and Herculo gave me a new high-powered air rifle. Later we went and used
it to put out a small boy's eyes. Ahh, I remember it as if it were yesterday...</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> [<i>not really listening, counting on her fingers</i> ] 126? Sam, do you
know what this means? </p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> He got on TV with Willard Scott?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> No! Little Leland is alive! He didn't die when he was a child!</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> [<i>slowly dawning on him</i> ] And if he didn't die, his parents never
founded the University in his memory! That means...</p>

<p><b>Both: </b>This <u>is</u> Stanford. [<i>they share a moment of collective dread.</i>

<p><b>Leland:</b> Hey, quit yer yappin, you little pantywaist! This is MY park and I'M the

Yippee!...</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> [<i>aside</i> <i>to Lydia, while Leland turns cartwheels in the background </i>]
Lydia, we've got to do something - this guy has been taking sanity Pass/No Credit. He's
destroyed Stanford as we know it!</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> [<i>calming down a bit</i> ] Aha! The troublemakers have returned! Can't
get enough, can you? Well, let the punishment begin. The way I see it, you have twooooo
choices. One, you can either pay me the fine, or B, the girl stays with me and the boy
goes to the salt mines! </p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> What's the fine?</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> A million billion dollars!</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Ummm... I've got this switchblade comb...</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> Oooh! Gimme gimme gimme! [<i>looks it over reverently</i> ] Verrry
nice... But not nice enough! Boris! Take him to the salt mines! [<i>The goon starts to
drag Sam off left. Leland eyes Lydia lasciviously</i> ] As for you, sweet thang, you will
stay here and dance for me! Jig! Jig, I say! [<i>He pulls out a kazoo and begins to play a

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Jig this, asshole! [<i>she grabs the frozen turkey and bashes Leland over
the </i><b>:</b> <i>head with it. In the ensuing battle, Sam rescues Lydia from imminent
danger.</i>] Thank you. Let's get out of here!</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> [<i>struggling to stand </i>] Noooo! You'll pay for this! Mark my
words!! YOU WILL PAY!! [<i>He sees the switchblade comb where it lies.</i>] Aha! They
left, but they forgot one thing! [<i>Now a lounge singer, he starts singing a love song to

<p><b>Leland:</b> Halt, who goes there? </p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> It's me, Gordy. I lost my friends - Stanford students, about yay high? [<i>He

[ <i>The Goons unveil the portrait</i> . <i>It's of a stick figure.</i>] The Medicine

<p><b>Goons:</b> It's he! [<i>They cross themselves by sneezing and wiping their noses
like Gordy before.</i>] </p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> It's the second coming!!!</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> Many years ago ;you saved my life-- with this very bottle of
Sudafed(TM). [<i>He reaches under his collar and pulls out the bottle, which he now wears
on a chain around his neck.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Gordy sneezes. Goons and Leland cross themselves again. Gordy looks puzzled.</i></p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> It's just my hayfever actin' up. Sudafed? [<i>puts it together</i>] Look,
guys, I'm not a hero. It was only sinus medication-- five-eighty five over the counter.</p>

<p><b>Goon #2:</b> But you are the Medicine Man, O Great One.</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> I'm Gordy Schmegmeir. University of California at Berkeley? Class of '95?
[<i>offers his hand to Leland, by way of introduction</i>]</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> Cal Class of 1895? Me too! [<i>shakes </i>] Now that's a coinkie-dinkie.</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Listen, I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to go...</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> [<i>despairing </i>] But you mustn't, Gordy! I finally found you, I
can't let you go! Nooooo... Oh Gordy, you must remain here. Together we shall triumph, we
shall work wonders, we shall frolic in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee....</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Uh... that sounds great, mister, but I really have to find Lydia and Sam.
They keep leaving me places.</p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> <u>I</u> won't leave you, Gordy. You're the miracle worker that saved my
life. I'll always be indebted to you.</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> Gee, it feels nice to be a hero. No one's ever appreciated me before. I
can do anything I want! Cal is number one and there is no Stanford. No more envying a
dancing tree, no more listening to the sound of rattling keys reminding me of where my
life is not heading, and best of all, no more humiliating losses at sporting events.
Hmmm...Who's the Weenie now?! ... [<i>to Leland </i>] Hey you, old man - believe it or

<p><b>Sam:</b> Whew [<i>wiping his brow </i>] that was close. I think that Leland
character has volunteered for too many experiments up at SLAC.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Sam, this is so strange. Something must have happened to change the past.</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> We've got to find out. Without Stanford, there will be no axe, no Big Game,
no chance to kick Cal's ass.</p>

to do, kill him?</p>

<p><b>Tour guide:</b> Don't you worry about it. I think I can help. [<i>Walks over to
Forrest Gump</i> ] RUN FORREST RUN. [<i>Forrest begins to speed across the stage,
knowcking down little Leland in the process. The tourguideholds up his right hand, begins
walking across stage </i>] We're walking, we're walking. On your left, the famed Red Barn.
On your right, a haybale. [<i>Leads the group over Leland's confused self. Group tramples
him </i>] Underfoot, you may have noticed Leland Stanford Junior, being mercilessly
trampled by our collective weight...We're crushing, we're crushing....</p>

<p><i>Group looks down, takes pictures. They start to walk off. One tourist picks up
Leland's teddy.</i></p>

<p><b>Tour guide:</b> I'm sorry, but we request that you take only pictures, leave only
footprints.</p>

<p><i>As the rest of the tour group walks on, the tourist drops the teddy, stomps around
on Leland, then leaves. Sam and Lydia give the tour guide the thumbs up. He returns it,
then exits.</i></p>

<p><b>Leland:</b> [<i>trying to crawl away, singing Gavroche's theme, from Les Miz. </i>]
Cuz little people know, when little people bite, they may look easy pickin's but they got
some....[<i>He throws the teddy bear as he gives a final croak. It is a powerful moment.</i>]
</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Sorry, little guy. It was for the best. C'mon, let's go!</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> You know, I'm going to miss this place. The simple values, friendly
locals....[<i>To the scarecrow near the barn</i> ] I think I'll miss you most of all,
Scarecrow.</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> [<i>as they are leaving</i>] I hope this worked. Suppose he's not dead. I'd
hate to end up next in Leland Stanford Junior's Home for the Trampled.</p>

<p><i>As Sam and Lydia leave for the time machine, Jane enters with Leland Sr. in tow, and
</i></p>

<p><i>sees the bloody awful mess.</i></p>

<p><b>Jane:</b> Leland Senior, the worst has occurred! Typhoid has taken its terrible
toll!</p>

<p><i>Typhoid Fevah vamp and blackout. Time travel effects. End of scene.</i></p>

<p><b>2.6: &quot;Back on the Farm&quot;</b></p>

<p><i>The lights come up slowly on the same mid-way silhouette used for Le-Land. We hear
carnival music...doot doot doodle doodle doot doot doo. Is it too awful to be true? Sam
and Lydia enter before the stage lights are completely up. </i></p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Are we there?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> I'm not sure. What if it's Le-land...or worse? [ <i>Lights come up full.
Midway rises to reveal the same set as Leland's office, especially that beautiful $200
revolving throne we're going to buy.</i> ] Sam, this doesn't look good. Is it Stanford?</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>Let's find somebody in charge. [<i>to figure in throne</i> ] Excuse me? Who
is the president around here? [<i>throne turns around to reveal Academy Award -winning
Casper. </i>]</p>

<p><b>Casper:</b> I'm the president, silly. You must be Sam Cleveland and Lydia Berkowitz.
Holly Lazlofeld and Cooter [<i>they step out from behind the throne</i> ] asked me to help
find you. As you can see, that was as easy as getting into Cal.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Sam! We did it! Oh, Mr. President, we travelled back in time, and then a
Cal nerd changed the future into a horrific Berkeley carnival land. We didn't think we'd
ever get the Sure Cart back home.</p>

<p><b>Casper:</b> Well, welcome back, Cart-ers. [ <i>Badabing </i>] Just in time for Big
Game. An impromptu Night-before Rally is starting right now, so I better be off. </p>

<p><i>The Rally: three students shine flashlights on a miniature Hoover Tower. Some
Axe-Com person burns one fake fire log, sings Kumbaya, and holds a sign that says,
&quot;Welcome to the Doubt Fire. Hey Voters. Suck my Ass!&quot;</i></p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Holly! Cooter! I thought I'd never see you again. What have you been up to?</p>

<p><b>Holly:</b> Well, just practicing our engineering skills, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>Cooter:</b> Coo! Coo! Coo!</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> [<i>to Holly</i> ] I'm sorry I disobeyed you and used the time machine. It
works great, by the way, and I never want to see it again in my life. </p>

<p><b>Holly:</b> You mean it actually worked? Now I can finally go back and remember to
turn in my bookstore receipts! </p>

<p><i>Myra and Patrick enter. She's back to normal.</i></p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Myra, is it really you? And is that really....[<i>disgusted </i>] Patrick
Swayzee?</p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Quite a dreamboat, huh? Patrick's letting me be his dance partner in his
next movie, Roadhouse 2: Electric Boogaloo.</p>

<p><b>Patrick: </b>Nobody puts Baby in the corner.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>Well, at least you're not a Weenie. It's good to see you again. </p>

<p><b>Myra: </b>Yes. [<i>lovingly sarcastic</i> ] I've missed you so much since I last saw
you, yesterday. I see you've changed your mind about the Old Red Baron here.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>I guess I have. Hey Sam. There's one thing I never quite understood. What
were you doing with a time machine?</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Well, I wanted to go back and meet you again in the Coffee House, without
being such a moron.</p>

<p><b>Lydia: </b>All for me? Oh Sam. I knew from the moment we first talked that you were
more than just a conceited jerk.</p>

<p><b>Sam: </b>And I knew that you were more than just an intellectual snob! [<i>They
embrace and kiss</i>]</p>

<p><b>Casper:</b> Oh. I'm getting all Verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves. Topic: Gaieties
is neither gay nor a tease. Discuss.</p>

<p><b>Song 8: Finale</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p>Lydia:</b> Hoo has its Tow, Mem has its Chu,<br>
  Oh that's the way that I need you.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Sam:</b> Y has its M, G has its Q<br>
  Oh that's the way that I need you.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Both:</b> Well, we've been through time and back again and now I'm certain,<br>
  You,re the one that with my one makes two.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Cooter: </b>Holly, could you find the time to jump-start my engine</p>
  <p><b>Holly: </b>Cooter, I'd find any time for you....</p>
  <p><b>All Four: </b>Stanford needs to beat those weenies 69 to 2<br>
  Oh that's the way that I need you<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>All: </b>Stanford's back and feeling strong<br>
  The best there's ever been<br>
  Berkeley might try, but they'll never get by<br>
  Cause Weenines--We got in!<br>
  </p>
  <p>Slam poor Oski to the ground<br>
  Then serve them up as snacks<br>
  Kick their ass all over the grass<br>
  Then come home with the axe.<br>
  </p>
  <p>We're gonna beat Cal now in Big Game<br>
  The axe will be returned<br>
  Make Berkeley bow down to the Tree<br>
  When will those Weenies learn?<br>
  </p>
  <p>We're gonna beat Cal now in Big Game<br>
  Fear the Cardinal name<br>
  Saturday fever, be a frim believer<br>
  Let's go out and WIN.....BIG....GAME!<br>

<p>End of song, Obviously.</i></p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Sorry about all the sarcasm.</p>

<p><b>Sam:</b> Sorry about all that macho crap.</p>

<p><b>Holly:</b> Sorry about the invention I left in the bed.</p>

<p><b>Cooter:</b> Sorry about the bicycle lubricant. [<i>ew gross</i> !]</p>

<p><b>Gordy:</b> [<i>in juliet</i> ] Sorry you time traveling morons ruined my Weenie

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Yeah, well, we're not about to give up center stage for Simon the
dog-faced boy and a bunch of Carnival freaks! </p>

<p>HERE COMES THE BAND--THE END</p>

<p>Version Info</a></p>

<p>This was the script given to the cast at the first cast meeting in early October, but
isn't exactly the final performed version. </p>

<p>The biggest difference was the removal of all but the first verse of the
&quot;Le-Land&quot; song. Music was written for the other verses, but there was not enough
time to choreograph and teach the dance to the cast, much less Dean Montoya. </p>

<p>Adrian created a scene in front of red to fill dead-time during the scene change to the
CoHo. The scene featured a CoHo MC doing a poetry reading, and Mick Jagger and Keith
Richards exchanging knock-knock jokes. </p>
