Above, the cast frolics in the waves off Pajaro Dunes.<p>

To the left, Executive Producer Jeff Meador '95 gets his hair dyed a
lovely shade of green by Set Designer Blake Naughton (left) and
Lighting Designer Antoine Picard.  Jeff also died his hair red at the
One-Acts retreat.  We are hoping he will do something equally exciting
to his hair at the <cite>Once On This Island</cite> retreat!<p>
