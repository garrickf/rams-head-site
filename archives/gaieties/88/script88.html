Have you noticed what the writers' strike has done to Hollywood?  Shut the
whole town down.  You need us.  Love us, worship us, buy us beer.  And what did
David Letterman describe producers as?  I quote, &quot;money-grubbing scum!&quot;  Take
that.  Nyaaah.  By the way, Hi Marty, Mike and Kieth!  I sure hope the work on
the holograms is going well, because I think they'll look great in the &quot;Who
Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; parody, since we could use holograms for the 45 cartoon
characters in that scene.  I don't care how you do it, just &quot;make it soar!&quot;
Tee hee.<p>

CURTAIN RISES TO REVEAL THE SINGERS, DANCERS, AND MANY EXTRAS AND OTHER
OBNOXIOUS ACTOR-TYPES AROUND THE BARBECUE PIT TYPE-THINGY.  A BIG SIGN MAKES
CLEAR THAT THIS IS &quot;THE AXE COMM BARBECUE&quot;  THERE IS A BIG BARBECUE PIT (OR
SOMETHING) AND DAVE, APRIL, AND ELVIS ARE SITTING AROUND WITH THE AXE COMM (5
[or so] OF THEM ARE ALL ATTACHED TO THE AXE.  ALL THE TIME.  THEY ALL WEAR
JEANS, LONG SLEEVED WHITE SHIRTS, AND RED OBNOXIOUS POLO SHIRTS OVER THE WHITE
SHIRTS.  UNDERSHIRT OPTIONAL.).  YOU CANNOT SEE THAT THE AXE COMM IS ATTACHED
TO THE AXE YET, THOUGH.</i><b><p>
<p>
Axcomperson1</b>: Oh gee, isn't it mighty fine that we have the axe.<p>
<b><p>
Axcomperson2</b>: Yes.  I feel it positively reflects on our self-worth as
human beings.<p>
<i><p>
Axcompeople begin to talk among themselves.  Random barbecue attendees mill
around.  One approaches the committee with small child.  </i><p>
<b><p>
Randomperson1</b>:  OOH The axe committee!  <p>
<b><p>
Axcomperson3</b>: Hey, stop right there!  Are you a Weenie?<p>
<b><p>
Randomperson1</b>:  No, of course not!  Can my little girl see the axe?  Can
she?  Can she pleeeese?  You see she's dying of Andy Gibb's disease and it's
her last wish to see the axe, so can she please?<p>
<b><p>
AxeCommitte</b><i> (together):</i>  No!  It's ours!  Get away!<p>
<i><p>
Child starts to cry.</i><p>
<b><p>
Randomperson</b> <b>1</b>: Aaaww, now you've made her cry!<p>
<b><p>
Axecomperson 3</b>: Okay, okay, as long as you're not weenies I guess we
can...<p>
<i><p>
The entire Axe committee does the Axe Yell:  &quot;GIVE 'EM THE AXE THE AXE THE AXE,
ETC.&quot;  After the second &quot;RIGHT IN THE NECK&quot; The child runs off screaming.</i><p>
<b><p>
Axecomperson 4</b>:  Geez, that seems to happen more and more these days.  <p>
<b><p>
Entireaxecommitte</b>: Maybe it's our deodorant?<p>
<b><p>
Axecomperson 2:</b>  No, it's not!  It's because, more than anything else, WE
LOVE OUR AXE!!!<p>
<i><p>
[Song:  KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF MY AXE.  A cute little tune about how
totally anal-retentive the AxeComm is.  They try to dance while chained to the
Axe, and it looks gloriously silly.  I'm sure the composers will have lyrics
for this to us soon... hint, hint]</i><p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: C'mon Dave, April, we're Stanford students - they've gotta let
<u>us</u> see the axe!<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: I don't know Elvis - did you see what they did to that other guy?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b><i> (does his Presley impression):</i>  Uh uh huh!<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>: Don't be such wooses guys - we've gotta be daring, brave, bold -
we've gotta show spine - we've gotta get this show started! We've...<p>
<b><p>
April</b><i> (she cuts off Dave):</i> Okay, I'll ask.  <i>(She steps
forward)</i>  Excuse me - do you think we three - ahem - <u>Stanford
Students</u> could see the axe?<p>
<b><p>
Axecommittee</b>: NO!  (They whisper among themselves.  random lines come out.
&quot;We must protect the sacred axe - They are main characters and we're only minor
characters - Look at you, you're barely a cameo - Am not - You don't even have
a line, go ahead and try and talk! - Mmmphmmph!) <p>
<b><p>
Axecomm2</b>: Wellllll, seeing as you are <u>THE MAIN CHARACTERS</u> : David,
<i>(LOUD MUSIC HERE)</i> the simple, yet savvy roommate-type and possible love
interest of April May Jüne, <i>(SEXY MUSIC HERE)</i> the strong-willed
leading female-type - and possible love interest of Dave; and Elvis,
<i>(PRESLEY MUSIC HERE)</i> the sarcastic - yet strangely human character - I
guess you can see the axe.<p>
<i><p>
SIGHT GAG:  THE ENTIRE AXE COMMITTEE, CHAINED TO THE AXE WITH THOSE FLEXY BIKE
CABLES SHUFFLES OVER TO SHOW THE TRIO THE AXE.  MUCH LIKE THE CHAIN GANG IN
WOODY ALLEN'S </i><cite>TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN</cite><i>.  AND OH SO FUNNY.
MMMMM.</i><p>
<i><p>
The three marvel at the axe.  April, Elvis and a few AxeCommies say &quot;The Axe!&quot;
in quick succession, then...</i><p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  It's only a model!<p>
<b><p>
Everyone</b>: Shhhhh!<p>
<i><p>
ENTER PETITIONER  (to be explained)</i><p>
<b><p>
Petitioner</b>: Excuse Me...<p>
<b><p>
Axecomm1</b>: What? Are you a weenie?<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner</b>: No, of course not!<p>
<b><p>
Axecomm3</b>: Well, okay then, you may approach.<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner</b><i> (approaches Gretchen (Carlson), an AxeCommie):</i> Hi, I'm a
Stanford Freshman.  My social life's been a little slow since I got here, and
so I was just wondering if you'd like to go out on a...<i>(real huge
pause)</i>...a date?  <i>(Big huge Orchestra riff: dun dun dunnnn!)</i><p>
<b><p>
Everyone on the whole damn stage at this point</b>:  A DATE!?<p>
<b><p>
Gretchen</b> <i>(squirming): </i>Uh, well no.  I don't.  But don't be
disappointed.  Have you considered going to the Undergraduate Dating Center in
Old Union?<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner</b>:  What's that?<p>
<b><p>
Gretchen</b>:  It's an bureau set up to deal with geeks... I mean people like
you.  They can find just the kind of person you're looking for.  <i>(April
starts to escort him to side of stage)</i>  In fact, maybe you should go
there... right... now!  <i>(she finishes the sentence and virtually shoves him
off the stage)</i><p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  Gretchen Elizabeth, that was cruel, mean, and downright heartless.<p>
<b><p>
Gretchen</b>: It worked, didn't it?  Hell, maybe they could even help him.
Besides, I'm a Kappa!<i>  (with this, the orchestra starts into &quot;Here She
Comes, Miss America&quot; as Gretchen strips down to a swimsuit and a sash that says
&quot;Miss Gaieties&quot;.  Two assistants come out and crown Gretchen and give her a
bouquet of roses.  She beams, waves to the audience, and struts offstage.  No
one seems to notice...)</i><p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:<i>  (looks into the barbecue) </i> These hot dogs look raw!  They
look like they're about to get up and walk away.  What say we order a pizza,
eh?<p>
<i><p>
PHONE IS TOSSED ONSTAGE (from first lighting beam, suggests Keith Cross).
ELVIS ORDERS.  AT THIS POINT 3 LARGE HOT DOGS (THAT IS ACTORS IN HOT DOG
COSTUMES, OR &quot;WEENIES&quot;, UNDERSTAND?) GET UP FROM SOME HIDDEN PLACE.  THEY WALK
OVER TO AXE COMMITTEE.  THEY (THE HOT DOGS, NOT THE AXE COMMITTEE) HAVE GERMAN
ACCENTS.</i><p>
<b><p>
Weenie1</b>: Phaze vun uf ze master plan iz cumpleet!  Ze Acks Cummittee
suzpeckts nussink!<p>
<b><p>
Weenie2</b>: Kud vee order ein pizza mit Saurkraut, also?<p>
<b><p>
Weenie1</b>: <i>(Bopping Weenie 2 with his giant weenie hand)</i> Dummkopff!
Dummkopff!  Now izz not ze tyme for füd!  Vee must put faze too uf ze
master plan into ackshun - unt steel ze ACKS!<p>
<i><p>
ALL WEENIES NOD (THIS WILL LOOK VERY FUNNY, TRUST US).</i><p>
<b><p>
All Weenies</b>: Yah, Yah!<p>
<i><p>
THE WEENIES APPROACH THE AXE COMMITTEE</i><p>
<b><p>
Axecommperson4</b>: Halt!  Are you weenies?<p>
<b><p>
Weenie 2</b>: Yah!<p>
<b><p>
Weenie 1</b>: Nein, Nein!  I mean -  no, no, Weenies?  Of course not!  What do
you mean?  <i>(Kicks Weenie 2)</i>.  We are just Hot Dogs out for morning
stroll.<p>
<b><p>
AxeCommperson</b>:  Well, okay then.  I suppose this <u>is</u> a barbecue.  Hot
dogs are okay.<p>
<i><p>
THE AXECOMMITTEE GOES BACK TO TALKING.  THE WEENIES CONFER.</i><p>
<b><p>
Weenie 1</b>: Otto!  Now iz our chance! Helmut, get reddy!  <p>
<i><p>
(BIG PAUSE......)</i><p>
<b><p>
All Weenies Together</b>:  GET IT!<p>
<i><p>
THE WEENIES GRAB THE AXE, MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE COMMITTEE, WHO ARE DRAGGED
ALONG BEHIND THE AXE, OFFSTAGE.</i><p>
<b><p>
April</b>: The Weenies have stolen the Axe <u>and</u> The Axe Committee!  Get
them!<p>
<i><p>
MAYHEM.  PANDEMONIUM.  ETC.  IN OTHERWORDS, THE WEENIES RUN OFF, AS LIGHTS DIM
AND THE VARIOUS PEOPLE ONSTAGE BASICALLY DISAPPEAR OFFSTAGE.  CHACE MUSIC.  OR
CHASE MUSIC, IF YOU LIKE.  THE WEENIES &amp; COMMITTEE RUN ON STAGE AND OFF AND
0UR THREE UNLIKELY HERO-PERSONS FOLLOW IN HOT PURSUIT.  AFTER VARIOUS ENTRANCES
AND EXITS, THE WEENIES NO LONGER APPEAR AND OUR THREE HERO-PEOPLE ARE LEFT
ALONE, CENTER STAGE, IN FRONT OF THE CURTAIN, WHICH HAS DROPPED SOMETIME DURING
THE CHASE.  THE CHARACTERS ARE BREATHING HEAVILY, AS IF THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING.
LONG PAUSE.  APRIL LOOKS AT ELVIS.  </i><p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Well?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: Well what?<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b> <i>(stage whisper):</i> <i>Your line!<p>
</i><b><p>
April</b>: I don't believe this.  We've been practicing the whole quarter and
you forget your line in the first scene!<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: Me?  I don't have a line.  One of you must have a line.<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Dave?<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>: Not me.<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Well I certainly don't have one.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: Oh Shit.  Something's not right here!<p>
<i><p>
AT THIS POINT, SLIMY TECHIE TYPES (OVERALLS, PLEASE) BEGIN TO PLACE THE PROPS
FOR THE GAME SHOW SCENE IN FRONT OF THE CURTAIN.</i><p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Who's got a script?<p>
<i><p>
(A WEENIE SNEAKS UP AND GIVES APRIL A SCRIPT.)<p>
<p>
THE THREE PORE OVER THE SCRIPT.  LOOK UP AT AUDIENCE.</i><p>
<b><p>
All Three</b>: Uh Ohhhhhh.<p>
<b><p>
April</b>:  I can't believe it.  We're not here.<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  What do you mean, &quot;not here&quot; - I'm here, Elvis is here...<p>
<b><p>
April</b>:  No, no, I know we're <i>here</i>.  I mean we're not here
<i>(pointing),</i> in the script.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  How can we not be there?  We're the lead characters!<p>
<b><p>
April</b>:  Not any more.  We've fallen out of the script.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  But that's not fair.  I wanna go back and chase the weenies around
like in a normal stupid Gaieties plot.<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b> <i>(overacting):</i> Too bad Elvis, it seems that we've stumbled
through a hole in the plot - and now we're stuck in some God-forsaken portion
of the nether-regions of lost scenes.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: You mean...<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>: That's right Elvis, while on some other plane the weenies hold our
treasured axe and romp and frolic to their heart's content in the <u>real</u>
plot - we sit here in a veritable limbo among scenes discarded from some of the
most horrendous dramatic efforts ever to be produced.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: You mean...<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Cut the dramatics Dave.  We're fucked.  How are we going to get back
into the plot?  <i>(HANDS SCRIPT BACK TO TECHIE FROM WHENCE IT CAME.)
</i>Excuse me, but can you tell us how to get back to the real plot?<p>
<b><p>
Techie</b> <i>(pointing as he goes)</i>:  Sure, start behind this podium, go
straight through the dorm life scene, take a right at the mystery scene and a
left two scenes later.  If you hit the band you've gone too far.<p>
<b><p>
April:</b>  Thanks.<p>
<i><p>
(TECHIE EXITS.)</i><p>
<b><p>
<a name="game">GAME SHOW SCENE:</a></b><i>Scene:  April and Elvis go behind one of three bidding
podium platform thingys like in Price is Right.  Price is Right (cheesy
gameshow) music is playing.  Dave goes over and starts fondling a model of a
Wilbur dorm room  -- i.e., a  large shoebox --which is rotating on the stage.
Two models are standing in it, pointing out its obvious beauty.  Dave does not
fondle them.</i><p>
<b><p>
April</b>:  C'mon let's get outta here and find the plot.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  Yeah, and get the Axe back too.  C'mon Dave!<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  No, dammit, I'm unguaranteed.  <i>(Pointing)</i>  I want this dorm
room!<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  Don't be a fool.  Can't you see that's [whatever dorm has block
tickets, from Wilbur or Stern].<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b> <i>(passionately):</i>  I don't care; I want it.  Besides, this is
California--we have to be on a gameshow... It's the law.  <i>(heads back to
podiums)</i><p>
<b><p>
Johnny</b>: <i>(Johnny is the announcer for the show, and hence is only a
mysterious distended voice from offstage)  </i> It's the Price is Right...
starring Bob Barker.<p>
<i><p>
(enter Bob Barker  &quot;Applause&quot; sign goes on. Two contestants enter and fill up
the other podium thingys)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bob Barker</b>:  Thank you, thank you for that lovely hello.  And welcome to
&quot;The Price of the Square Pyramid is $18,249.&quot;  Johnny, tell them what they've
won.<p>
<b><p>
Johnny</b>:  No, no Bob, not yet.  We need to meet our contestants first!<p>
<b><p>
Bob Barker</b>:  I knew that.  Johnny, who are our first contestants on The
Price is Right?<p>
 <b><p>
Johnny</b> <i>(maximum condescension)</i>:  Why don't you ask them yourself,
Bob, they're right in front of you.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Oh, uh, yeah.  Contestant number one, tell us a little about
yourself.  You're from Redondo Beach, California?<p>
<b><p>
Contestant 1</b>:  <i>(HITS BUZZER QUICKLY)</i>   That's right, Bob.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Correct.  For $100!  Do you have any kids, Contestant #1?<p>
<b><p>
Contestant</b> <b>1</b>:  <i>(HITS BUZZER AGAIN)</i>  I have three children,
Bob.  Their names are Katy, Bill, and....uh.....um.....<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Contestant 2.  You get the chance to steal.<p>
<b><p>
Contestant 2</b>:  <i>(HITS BUZZER)</i>  Bob, his third child would be Sally.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  <i>(Applause)  </i>Correct for a hundred dollars.  What do you do for
a living, Contestant number 2?  <p>
<b><p>
Contestant 2:</b>  I'm a mechanical engineer. <p>
<i><p>
(Loud sound buzzes, indicating incorrectness)<p>
</i><b><p>
Contestant 1</b>: <i>(Hitting buzzer)  </i>He's a child psychologist, Bob.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  That's exactly right!  <i>(Applause sign)  </i>A hundred dollars for
you.  Johnny, tell them what they've won.<p>
<b><p>
Johnny</b> <i>(despairingly, frustrated, [insert adjective here]):</i>  Not
yet, Bob.  But here's the first item up for bids...  It's a lovely Wilbur dorm
room.  Yes you'll relax in the exquisite luxury of this eight by five suite.
Rated by the Housing Office for you and up to three of your friends.  The room
comes fully furnished with bed, desk, and towel rack.  All this can be yours,
if, the Price is Right.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>: Now, Contestant number one, what do you bid on this room?<p>
<b><p>
Con #1</b>:  Does that come with a sink and bath?<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Johnny?<p>
<b><p>
Johnny</b>:  Oh, Christ!  No, of course not.<p>
<b><p>
Con #1</b>:  1.3 trillion dollars.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Dave, April May Jüne, and Elvis, what's your bid?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: <i>(after consulting briefly)</i>  That would be 251 dollars and 31
cents.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Contestant #2?<p>
<b><p>
Contestant #2</b>:  I bid one dollar, just like you told me before the show.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Shhh!<p>
<i><p>
(Bell goes off)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Well, it looks like somebody's exactly right... Shall I break the
suspense?  <i>(opens envelope)</i>  And the actual retail price of a Wilbur
dorm room is...  $251.31.  Dave, April, and Elvis, come on up here.  <i>(they
follow him to center stage)</i>   April, since you bid exactly right, you get
to come on over and reach into my hundred-dollar pocket.  <i>(April reaches
into Bob's pocket.  He squirms)</i>  Whoa!!  It's not a gold bar... heh, heh,
heh... it's a hundred dollar bill.  Keep reaching.  <i>(April continues to fish
around.)</i>  Whoa, whoa, whoa!!  <i>(She finally gets the hundred
dollars).</i>  Oh, that was great, April.  Looks like it's time for Hollywood
Square!  Now let's meet our returning champion.<p>
<i><p>
(The Wilbur dorm room has since been wheeled off,</i> <i> and Duke Squidlow
bounds onto stage.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Johnny</b>:  Duke Squidlow is an Engineer from La Jolla, California.  He's
married, with two lovely children, Jack and Diane, who are in the studio
audience tonight. <i>(Family stands up and waves.)</i>   He enjoys raquetball,
scuba diving, and ballet.  Unbeknownst to his wife, about three years ago Duke
had an extra-marital affair with his secretary, Pam, who is also in the studio
audience tonight.  <i>(Pam stands up and waves.)</i>  A year ago, Duke killed
the family dog out of anger, telling the children it was hit by a car instead.
If found guilty of the charge in...<i><p>
(Duke pulls out a gun and fires offstage.  He then goes behind a vacant
thingy)</i><p>
<b><p>
Johnny</b>:  Aaaaaaaaaagh!!<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Nice shot, Duke.  Let's meet today's square.<i><p>
(A single Hollywood square is wheeled onto stage.  The name &quot;Paul Lynde&quot; is lit
up in front of the desk behind the square.  Two burly stagehands drag the
corpse of Paul Lynde onto the stage and drape him over the desk.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Since we're too CHEAP to actually build nine squares, it look like
one will just have to do.  Dave, April and Elvis, you're our challengers, so
you get to go first. Go ahead, pick a square.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  Any square?<b><p>
<p>
Bob</b>:  Sure, whatever one you want.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  I'll take George Gobel.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  George Gobel's not here.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  OK, we'll take Audrey and Judy Landers.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>: <i>(hissing)  </i> They're not here either, dammit.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  Wayland Flowers and Madam?<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>: <i>(quite pissed now) </i>  NOOO!! ALL WE'VE GOT IS PAUL LYNDE!!<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  Allright, I guess we'll take Paul Lynde for the win.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  OK, Paul, you listening, here's the question.  What's the average
weight of the Hungarian Buffalo?  <i>(No answer from Paul.)</i>   Paul?  Paul?
Well Elvis, Paul appears to be dead.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  I think you're right.  I'll agree with that.<p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  <i>(very confused) </i> Judges?<p>
<i><p>
(After a brief pause a bell sounds indicating correctness.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bob</b>:  Judges say that's right.  Paul Lynde has in fact been dead for three
years.  Paul Lynde, always the master of impersonation, let's see you do your
Andy Gibb.  <i>(SILENCE)</i>   Outstanding, Paul.  Now let's see your [topical
dead person].  <i>(SILENCE)</i>   Great, Paul.  Now let's see you do Olympic
Bronze Medalist Debi Thomas.  <i>( PAUL FALLS FROM HIS PERCH WITH AN AWKWARD
THUD ONTO THE FLOOR).</i>  Paul, you kill me.  Let's give a big round of
applause for Paul Lynde.  <i>(APPLAUSE SIGN)</i>  Congratulations, Dave, April
and Elvis. you've won.  Duke, too bad you didn't have a chance to play.  Now
get the hell out.  It's time for the new champions to play... Eighteen thousand
two hundred and fourty-nine dollar pyramid!!<i>(Duke leaves)</i>  And it's a
great pleasure for me to introduce tonight's guest stars on the pyramid... all
the way from Stanford University, please welcome President Donald Kennedy and
his lovely wife Robyn!  <i>(Don and Robyn enter on side of stage opposite the
one with podium thingys.  They sit at that silly &quot;Pyramid&quot; kind of table (you
know, with the TV thingy that comes out of it)  Bob comes over to chat with
them) </i>  Well, Don and Jean, it's great to have you here with us. But a lot
of people claim that game shows are cheap and tawdry, promoting an unhealthy
greed for money.  Is being here a big change from the atmosphere at Stanford?<p>
<b><p>
Don</b> <i>(after a moment's thought):</i>  No.  Not really.<p>
<b><p>

with Big Game.  Mrs. Kennedy, please describe for President Kennedy these
things that are associated with Big Game.  You have thirty seconds... go!<p>

Robyn</b> (these lines could be stuffed in the desk, so memorization is not
key):  O.K., Don, this is a... beverage that a lot of Stanford students drink
at football games...<p>

Don</b>:  Diet Coke?<p>
<b><p>
Robyn</b> :  No, no, it's got a bit more of a kick to it... uh, it's made of
barley and hops and...<p>

Don</b>:  Metamucil?<p>

Robyn</b> :  No, forget it.  Pass.  Uh, this is something you do in the
sunlight...<p>

to beat is zero.  Dave and Elvis, you haven't played yet so you're up.

receive?<p>

<b><p>
Bob</b>:  I don't care, just pick one.<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  OK, I'll give.<p>

really.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  What?  What?  I don't get it?  Pass, pass.<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  It's medium sized.  It's not big, but not really small either.
<i>(Gesturing.)</i>  Like, this big.  Pass.  <i>(Elvis is still confused.)</i>
This is brown.  It has things on it.  It sometimes moves if you pick it up.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  I don't know.  More specific.  Pass.<p>

first one.<p>

Elvis</b>:  I didn't get the first one!!<p>

<a name="evangelist">THE CAMPUS EVANGELIST SCENE:</a></b>  <i>In front of Red.  At one end of the stage
a podium stands.  Facing it is a congregation of people who either sit on the
stage or in folding chairs.  The men and women fan themselves, waiting.
Suddenly the lights dim and two spots move quickly about the curtain (just like
at the beginning of any cheesy show, q.v. the Newlywed Game).  A booming
announcer's voice says:</i><p>
<b><p>
Announcer</b>: Welcome one and all to Reverend Sister Cindy's White Plaza faith
healing - where our motto is &quot;You sin, we win.&quot;  Sister Cindy will join us in a
moment, but first news from the world of sports.  In Intervarsity Christian
competition today it was Adventists 9, Episcopalians 7.  And remember, on the
way home tonight, heed Billy Graham's advice and &quot;ram heathens for Jesus&quot;.
And now, without further ado - Sister Cindy!<p>
<i><p>
Cindy enters, wearing a conservative but cheap dress that covers ankles,
wrists, neck etc. The congregation applauds.  She stands behind the podium.
All speak with thick Southern accents.</i><p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>: Oh, thank you, thank you for your lovely welcome!  God loves you for
it, he does!  People, I spoken to you of goodness in this world, have I not?<p>
<b><p>
Congregation</b>: Amen!<p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>: And I have spoken to you of the greatest good - Jesus?<p>
<b><p>
Congregation</b>: Hallelujah!<p>

Cindy</b>: And I have spoken to you of sin - how we hate sin, am I right?<p>
<b><p>
Congregation</b>: That's Right!<p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>:  And how we despise fornication?<p>
<i><p>
The congregation is noticeably silent.<p>
</i><b><p>
Cindy</b>: I said how we <u>despise</u> fornication - <b><u>don't</u></b> we?<p>
<b><p>
Congregation</b>: <i>(noticeably unenthused, mumbling quietly)
</i>Hallelujah.<p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>: I can't hear you!<p>
<b><p>
Congregation</b>: <i>(a little louder)   </i>Hallelujah.<p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>: That's better.  Today my flock I want you to tell me your
temptations - tell us and be rid of them!  Tell us and save yourself!  Tell us
and send that temptation back to Satan!  Tell us of it Dan!  <i>(Cindy goes to
her).  </i><p>
<b><p>
Dan</b><i> (total frat <b>dude</b>): </i> I'm tempted by <u>you</u> Cindy!  I
want you!<p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>: <i>(ruffled by this)  </i>Dan, let's return to your temptation a
little later, shall we?  Tell us your temptation, Bud!  Let me heal you!
<i>(she goes to Bud).</i><p>

Bud</b>: I'm tempted by sheep Cindy. A lot.<p>
<b><p>
Cindy</b>: Whoaa! <i>(whirls around, repulsed by the thought of touching Bud)
</i>Bud heal thyself!  <i>(She goes to another layperson)  </i>And you
Cynthia!<p>

Cynthia</b>:  I'm tempted to pledge Kappas!<p>

<b><p>
PETITIONER</b> - Hi. I'm a Stanford freshman and the Undergraduate Dating
Center in Old Union said they could get me a date if I can get petition
signatures from 10% of the Stanford student body, just like in spring
elections. I've calculated that if I can get twenty point six signature from
each house on campus, I'll be able to have a social life.  That even includes
the Theta Delts, that is if they can spell their names.  So if you guys would
care to help me, I'd really appreciate it. <p>
<b><p>
SUZIE</b>:  C'mon guys, let's give him a break...  <p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> <i>(stands up)  </i>: What are you talking about?  Would you go out

You really hurt me deeply April.  When's the last time you had a date?<p>

APRIL</b> - Oh... shut up! <i>(TO THE DORM AS WELL AS DAVE)</i><p>

to think of that one.  ...about as long as it's been since you had a date.<p>
<i><p>

one way to break this deadlock.  According to Article VII SECTION III of the
dorm Constitution, all voting ties must be broken by the R.F.'s.  Ohhh, R. F.

SISKEL</b> - <i>(SITS DOWN WITH EBERT AND FACES AUDIENCE, CROSSING THEIR LEGS

a very real individual.  I can relate to him in many ways.<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b> - Damn straight.<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> - Oh my lip.<p>
<b><p>
SISKEL</b> - He shows a lot of heart, strength, and courage.  Here's someone
who won't accept the hand life has dealt him. He's trying to make a change and,
really, I think he does a very convincing job.<p>
<b><p>
EBERT</b> - Gene, I really don't think we're looking at the same guy here.
He's got no drive, no ambition, he's just a... a... a <u>Eugene</u>!  C'mon,
this guy's idea of sexual consumation is to actually say &quot;hi&quot; to a girl.  I
think he's simply just a pathetic, wimpy character, and frankly Gene, I don't
find it surprising at all that you related to him.<p>
<b><p>
SISKEL</b> - Roger, I disagree heartily with you.  Finklestein is no less than
an authentic tragic hero in the highest sense and actually I think your lack of
sensitivity is more a reflection of you than this character.<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b> - Give him hell Gene!<p>
<b><p>
SISKEL</b> - Roger, what's more, I think that....<p>
<b><p>
EBERT</b> - <i>(INTERRUPTING)</i> ...well Gene maybe the reason you're
defending this guy is that you see a lot of your wimpy, weaselly, geekish past

never let me finish what I was going to say....<p>

couple things off my mind that have been irritating me just a little bit this
week.   First of all, I mean it's no big deal but I was only asked for the
master key a total of forty fucking times!!  Ohhh!   Ohhh!  Ohhhh!!   Don't you
people think that I have anything better to do than let you  into your
miserable little rooms.   (cute whining) But Sam, I locked myself out and I
have a midterm to study for tomorrow and it's real important and....TOO FUCKING
BAD!!!  I guess I don't have any work to do. I guess I never get the chance to
sleep or have any kind of privacy or social life because some people are too
irresponsible to carry their goddamn keys!!  But I'm sounding bitter.  All I
really wanted to remind you about is that dorm T-shirts are in and they're
$22.50 each and the guy at the T-shirt shop said they'd have been cheaper IF
YOU HADN'T USED FOURTEEN DIFFERENT COLORS ON EACH FUCKING SIDE!  OH OHH
OHHHH!!!!<p>

of Bad Dorm theatre.  You are in for a big treat tonight as [W.D.H.B.T.] dorm
this evening will be  putting on a particularly rancid play based ,so loosely
to the point of being disgusting , on the  Broadway play CATS.  Tonight's  T.S.
Eliot inspired feline extravaganza will be mutilated beyond recognition under
the clumsy auspices of Dorm director Katie Hoffman.  Pay particular attention
to the horrendous soloist Brooke Kelly in her bastardization of the role of the
glamour cat.  Truly a pathetic actress.  But enough of words.  Actions speak
louder than.  Action now with Bad Dorm theatre's presentation of CATS.<p>

Dave:</b>  How can you think of food at a time like this?<p>

April:</b>  Yeah, Elvis, what's more important to you?  The plot or your
pizza?<p>

DAVE</b>:  See, I told you we could work things out.  <i>(he opens lid.  The
leads squirm)</i>  Uh, wait a second dude.  This isn't what we ordered.  We
wanted ham and pineapple, not bratwurst and... is that marshmallow?<p>

[APRIL BEGINS SINGING &quot;MINOR ANTIPATHY (NOT ROMANTIC)&quot; (OR &quot;HOT AFTER THAT
PLOT&quot;)<p>

   This song is being written by the composers, and should express the tension
between the characters, along with a slight bit of warmth growing between April
and Dave (but not obviously... we still have 40 pages to go)  ]</i><b><p>
<a name="lecture">THE LECTURE SCENE:</a> </b><i>The scene takes place in a Biology class.  There are
students milling around, reading the Daily, in preparation for the class to
begin.  In front of the class is a desk or podium or something for the
professor to stand behind.  There are, however, no geese in the room.  None!
Most of the dialogue is &quot;thought&quot; by the actors.  This means that when a
character is listed with &quot;Con&quot; (Conscious) he is hit with a spotlight on the
stage, and we hear what he is &quot;thinking&quot; by a voiceover from offstage.  The
other characters should be more dimly lit, so that when a character is doing
the thinking we can tell for sure by the spotlight.  Jill suggests that this
might actually be possible by either using specials for each character or by
perhaps moving the spot from person to person rather than have it (ha, ha)
instantly appear on an actor/actress.  Maybe she can work out sound, too.
We're under the impression that this is, with work, feasible.  To quote
lighting-dick Matt Abrahams: &quot;Let the lighting geeks figure it out... Hey, did
I say that?&quot;<p>
<p>
April, Dave, and Elvis  are left on stage as the curtain rises.<p>
</i><b><p>
Elvis</b>:  <i>(looking around)  </i> Wow, where are we?<p>
<b><p>
April</b>:  I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  Hey!  This is a classroom.  I wonder if this class satisfies any
Distribution Requirements I need?  <i>(taps Crossword Puzz Guy on the shoulder)
</i> Excuse me, does this class satisfy any DRs?<p>
<b><p>
Cross Puzz Guy</b>:  Yeah, DR nine.<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  There's no such thing.<p>
<b><p>
Cross Puzz Guy</b>:  Sure there is.  It's new.  DR nine:  &quot;Things that are
medium-sized.&quot;<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  Oh good grief!  What will they think of next?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: <i>(leafing through a copy of Courses and Degrees)  </i>DR ten,
&quot;Things smaller than DR nine things, but not that much smaller,&quot;  DR eleven,
&quot;jokes that don't work,&quot;  DR twelve... uh, oh... class time.<p>
<i><p>
(Professor enters, carrying a cage with a live rabbit.  Seeing this, our three
heroes take their seats.  The professor goes to the front of the class.
Eventually the rest of the class find their seats, settle in, open their books.
You know, class type stuff.  Professor is facing the class, but his back is to
the audience, so you can't see his lips moving.  He begins lecturing,
eventually his voice will drone off so we just hear nonsense syllables or
something [like the teacher in Charlie Brown].  You can tape a real lecture if
you want.  We don't care.  Professor's voice should be a voiceover unless you
have an actor who can drone on for several minutes, or if a real professor
wants to do a cameo.)</i><p>

Professor</b>:  My good man, in as much as this <i>is</i>  a Biology class, it
nonetheless does not excuse you from speaking in English.  Would you please
attempt to use proper punctuation - may I suggest a comma or a period or two -

rigorous.<p>

is a member of the rodent species, he is better known for his more domestic
nature within the confines of several lesser known scientific variables.

There is a desk with a chair, and another chair in front of the desk.  A fan
spins slowly on the desk.  A file cabinet (or something easier to stage) is
stuffed too full with papers.  On the wall (or the file cabinet) is mounted a
handgun [joke coming].  No geese!  Sitting at the desk with his back to the
audience is Spade Fondue, private detective.  This scene screams for a cheesy
reference to &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but we haven't thought of one...
yet.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Spade</b>:  The day was hot and sticky.  Outside you could barely feel a wisp
of air in the summer sun.  It was 80 degrees, maybe 90.  Partly cloudy with a
chance of showers.  The sattelite pictures showed a cold front moving in from
the pacific basin.  The local forecast when we come back.<p>
       I was stuck here in a grimy office smaller than a Lagunita double,
working nine to five in a dead end job with low pay and high danger.  But I
can't stop now--it's part of what I am:  <i>(Turns around to face
audience.)</i>  Spade Fondue, private detective.  I was about to call it a day
when she walked into the office... and into my life.<p>
<i><p>
(A knock sounds at the door, and a short brunette wearing jeans and a t-shirt
enters.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Spade</b>:  She was 5'10 with blonde hair and more generous curves than the
sociology department, blue eyes that could kill a man at fifty paces, and legs
that wouldn't quit.<p>
<i><p>
(Hearing this, the girl looks at herself.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Girl</b>:  Sorry, wrong office.  <i>(Exits, bumping into blonde bombshell on
the way out.  Blonde enters, and begins pacing around the office.  As she
enters we hear the wail of a saxophone playing typical &quot;sexy blonde&quot; music.  A
few moments later a man playing the saxophone enters the room.)</i><p>

Blonde</b>:  <i>(to sax player)  </i> Thanks, I won't be needing you till the

erased!  <i>(Big music here.)</i>  Can you help me?<p>

Spade</b>: <i>(to audience)</i>   Here was this doll, alone, in a perplexing
world, and she needed my help.  All I had was a gun in my pocket and a license
on the wall.  <i>(Looks at the wall, notices that there is a gun there.
Reaches into pocket and fishes out a license.)</i>  Shit!  I couldn't decide
whether to take her case or not.  I think she sensed my indecision, because she
put on her coy act and showed me a little knee.  <i>(Blonde whips out a
mannequin's leg from behind the file cabinet or desk and shows it to
Spade.</i>) I took the case.<p>
<b><p>
Blonde</b>:  Oh thank you Mr. Fondue.<p>

Spade</b>:  The computer room?<p>

Spade</b> <i>(to audience)</i>  It was then I knew I was dealing with another
victim of... MAD MAC!!  <i>(Big music here.)</i>  In the past few weeks the
campus had been in chaos as this mysterious criminal snuck into dorms and

<b><p>
Blonde</b>:  Well, there was one suspicious looking fellow.<p>
<b><p>
Spade</b>:  Can you give me a description of him.<p>
<b><p>
Blonde</b>:  Well, I only caught a glance of him.  I'd say he was about 5'6&quot;,
147 pounds, with brown hair, and dark, meditteranean features--probably from
the Greek-Turkish border.  He had a patch over one eye and a scar on his left
forefinger.  He walked with a limp as if he had been shot by a pellet gun in
his early childhood.  Probably at the age of nine.  He wore size eight shoes,
likes jazz rock fusion and some classical music.<p>
<b><p>
Spade</b>:  Damn it!!  That could be anybody.  Did you notice anything
distinguishing?<p>
<b><p>
Blonde</b>:  Well, he did have a red backpack slung over one shoulder.<p>
<b><p>
Spade</b>:  Aha!  Now we're getting somewhere.  Unfortunately, he's a wily
criminal, a master of disguise.  He probably has dozens of different colored
backpacks in his closet.  Do you realize, doll, that we're dealing with the
criminal element?<p>

<i>(All characters look at their guns, sigh, and drop them)</i>  It was
committed with one of these.  <i>(Spade whips out a very large magnet.
Characters gasp and shrink back in horror.) </i><p>
      This is the HT-4 eighteen megahertz electromagnet.  Specifically designed
by Swiss scientists, it is singularly capable of wiping out a macintosh disk in
under 4.2 seconds.<p>
   <i>  (As he begins this next speech, Suzy begins inching closer and closer
to Spade, as if she is being dragged by [hint] a giant magnet.)</i><p>
      At first I was thrown off track by the fact that <i>(pointing at Phi Beta
Kappa) </i> <u>your</u> father owns the largest magnet company this side of
Pittsburgh.  But of course, I realized you couldn't have done it because you
were busy holding up that 7-11.<p>
     <i> (Suzy is being pulled even closer [nudge, wink] and is struggling
against the pull.  All of which, of course, is totally lost on Spade.)</i><p>
      Then I suspected you <i>(pointing at Duke)</i>,  and I would have been
fooled except the culprit neglected to take into account that it was raining
last night, and that broken glass from a window always falls <i>into</i>  a
room - <i>and</i> there were fingerprints on the teacup despite the fact that
the saucer was completely clean.  <i>(Big music.)</i><p>

Spade</b>:  I'm getting there.  <i>(Begins waving the magnet around more, and
Suzy is being buffetted from side to side.)</i>  However, after reviewing all
of the facts it became evident that the criminal had made the the classic
blunder - and got involved in a land war in Asia, completely giving away their
identity!  It was... <i>(dramatic pause, maybe some big music)</i>  YOU!!
<i>(Points the magnet at April in a wild sweep.  As he does this, Suzy is
finally dragged across the room until she is stuck by her side to Spade's

(Suzy whips out an equally large magnet, and a big magnet fight ensues.  Each
in turn attempting to draw the other close and then reverse the polarity,

succeeds in flinging Suzy against the refrigerator, where she sticks.)</i><p>

comes onstage playing her song.)</i><p>

of the evening.  I could sense that this doll was ready to come back to my
place and share a few drinks and a lot of laughs.  <i>(Blonde looks at Spade,

set (go techies go!), is the Psi Phi rush party, and all sorts of people (that
term is used loosely, many attendees are decidedly <b>not </b>human) are
milling around, drinking beer, etc.  Lots of stuff with the greek letters Psi
and Phi are all around, in the hopes that the audience might figure out that
this is a frat(...ernity, sorry Bob).  Also throw in a banner that says &quot;Rush
'88!&quot;.  Keg is kind of center stage, in a dry ice bucket. The set (and
atmosphere) is somewhat reminiscent of the cantina scene from &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
You'll see why...</i><p>
<b><p>
V.O.</b> (Kirk, or more correctly, whoever's playing him):  Stardate 1.9.88.
Mr. Spock and I have beamed down to the planet's surface in hopes of learning
more about a strange fraternal custom called...&quot;rush&quot;.  This time, however,
we're not bringing any of those red-shirted security men.  I never know their

KIRK</b> <i>(to Spock):</i>  Spock, I believe it's a 20th century Earth custom
called &quot;wet rush&quot;.  <p>
<b><p>
SPOCK</b> <i>(to Kirk):</i>  I find this &quot;wet rush&quot; to be highly primitive
behavior.<p>
<b><p>
KIRK</b>:  Well, it's all in fun.<p>

KIRK</b> <i>(to communicator): </i> Well, Jean, what do <u>you</u> think?<p>
<b><p>
V.O.</b> <i>(JEAN FETTER):</i>  Sorry Captain, but his essays weren't very
good.  The moral to his fable was to brush and floss after every meal.  His
one-word adjective to describe himself was &quot;Five-foot seven.&quot;  And worst of
all, his reccomendation was written by Mr. Buck Rogers, who said that he wanted
to be the applicant's neighbor.  But Dean Kahn at Berkeley said he'd be most

Chuck</b>: First we have Zorba.  He's a sophomore and says he &quot;likes numbers a

April? (<i>April still looks pretty grossed out and put off by the whole

Chuck</b>:  Well, let's meet Bud, then.  He's from Encino, California and says
he likes to &quot;get drunk and drive real fast.&quot;  He's a freshman majoring in date
rape and racism - oh, I'm sorry, that's Political Science.  I regret the error.
Bud thinks he's a pretty darn good date - let's find out why.<p>
<i><p>
Film Rolls.  Bud is almost completely clueless.  He is a dude: tan and thin,
with hair that would still look perfect in gale force winds.<p>
</i><b><p>
Bud</b>: Huh?  What, dude? <p>
<i><p>
(Whispered voice from off camera)<p>
</i><b><p>
Voice</b>: Why do you think you're a good date?<p>
<i><p>
Bud attempts to look thoughtful (no easy feat for this sunglass and tank-top
clad frat guy) and then looks down at his crotch.  He holds up his hands about
a foot apart (as if to indicate how big a fish he once caught was) and smirks,
stupidly.  Belches.  Back to Chuck.<p>
</i><b><p>
Chuck</b>: Well!  How 'bout that, huh?  They say a picture's worth a thousand
words and - well, you get the picture.  <i>(If April could force herself to
puke onstage she would do so now.)<p>

Chuck</b>: Whoa, hold on - you haven't even seen Dave, our third candidate.<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Dave?  <i>(She turns around to watch. Orchestra starts to play a
soft and wispy romantic melody)<p>

Bud on screen.  Meter needle goes higher, but not by a whole lot).  </i>Finally
we have Dave. <i>(Applause-o-meter goes wild.  Explodes.  Hi Jill!).  </i>Well,

who's it going to be?<p>
<b><p>
April</b>:  This is stupid!  I don't want to go out with anyone...<p>

Chuck</b>: Now, now, let's try to break out of that Stanford mentality...<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Will you stop that!  I just want to find Elvis and Dave and the plot

<b><p>
Chuck</b>: Great, then let's bring Dave on out here! <i>(The same two burly
stagehands from the Gameshow scene, along with a weenie (for Jill),drag Dave
out and virtually throw him into the vicinity of the couch.  He is not as easy
to drag as Paul Lynde, but they still manage.)  </i>You two look so cute
together - don't they folks?  Well Dave and April, here's the Newlywed Game
grand prize chosen <b>just </b>for you...uh, I mean, let me tell you about your
date - here put these on <i>(At this point the two stagehands have already
obtained some clothing type stuff from behind the white couch.  They toss a
long pink skirt to April (or whatever color matches her top)  and also a
matching hat - the hat is the silly medieval maiden type, a big pointy cone
with a scarf attached to the top.  They then assist Dave with the donning of a
chain mail tunic,  and a belt, helmet, and two-handed sword.  All this is going
on while Chuck is describing the date.)  </i> Dave, April  - we're sending you
two to...<i>(Big dramatic pause)  </i>Jolly Olde England!  That's right,
through the magic of the giant red curtain we'll send you two back 800 years
into the 11th century.  For six days and nights you'll stay in the land of
chivalry and castles, lords and ladies, rats and the black plague!  Dine in a
damp stone fortress where you'll feast on giant legs of mutton and flagons of
mead!  Take midnight strolls on the legendary werewolf infested moors!  Dave
and April, bathing and brushing will become things of the future as you relax
in serf hovels and forage for slop in the king's compost heap - yes, who could
ask for a more exciting and romantic first date?  And all this because you
made...A Love Connection!  <i>(By now Dave and April are clad in their medieval
garb.  They look confused.  Chuck sits down on the white couch and the two
stagehands lift and carry the couch - and therefore Chuck - offstage.)  </i>

closer inside the curtain.  There stands Elvis in full jester regalia.    Note
for Jill: If the actors and actresses can manage to speak with legitimate
(non-cockney) English accents without being too beastly about the whole thing

Elvis</b>: <i>(dryly) </i>   Good man fear not, thy &quot;<i>chaperone</i> &quot; is
near.<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Elvis, thy costume suits thy nature well.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: <i>(realizing he's just been insulted)    </i>Piss off. <p>
<i><p>
[A SONG WOULD BE VERY NICE HERE, CONSIDERING THE LEADS ONLY SING ONE OTHER
TIME.  THEN AGAIN, IF IT'S LIKELY TO BE STUPID (OR BAD COCKNEY), THEN PLEASE
DON'T BOTHER]</i><p>
<i><p>
(Weenies in Hot Dog costumes run across the back of the stage with the axe and
its faithful committee still attached - perhaps they run across a catwalk sort
of thingy. Perhaps not.)<p>
</i><b><p>
Dave</b>: What Ho! The plot evades us yon!  We go!<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: Foul Weenies stay and unhand thou that axe!<p>
<i><p>
(Our three intrepid heroes begin to run after said hot dogs, but suddenly they
stop in their tracks.  A black knight (called so because he is clad in black
plate mail) blocks their path.  This guy is huge.  At least eight feet tall.
Go Techies, Go!)<p>
</i><b><p>
BK</b>: Halt thy step, you muddy-mettled rascals!<p>
	Step not so fast lest I cleave thee in twain.<p>
<i><p>
(They're not stupid.  They stop in front of this monolith.)<p>
</i><b><p>
Dave</b>: Good Knight, forsooth we must pursue those dogs!<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: They hold, I fear, our lost plot's only hope.<p>
<b><p>
BK</b>: Thy plot is flown, mayhap I can assist<p>
	But think thou not that I am any fool<p>
	Let me make clear entirely my gist<p>
	To gain my aid you'll best me in a duel.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: Hey this is wild!  how completely cool!<p>
<b><p>
BK</b>: If thou art victor thou shalt have thy plot<p>
	My word is good, upon my honor here<p>
	But if perchance the champion you're not<p>
	I will relieve thee of thy maiden fair.<p>
<i><p>
The Black Knight strikes a dueling pose, ready to fight with Dave.<p>
</i><b><p>
Dave</b>:  A moment, please.  If only you will wait<p>
<b><p>
BK</b>: A moment <u>only</u> will I hesitate.<p>
<i><p>
Dave, April, and Elvis take a few steps away to consult with each other.</i><p>
 <b><p>
Dave</b>:  You art not ours to wager as a wife<p>
   	  Though it is true the plot we could collect<p>
	  <b><p>
April</b>:  And thou should surely forfeit thy good life<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>: We are agreed then<p>
<b><p>
April</b>: 		Right sir.<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>:  <i>(steps forward)     </i>		We accept!<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>:  Good Elvis!  Dost thou mean to fight this man?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis</b>: Me?  She's <u>your</u> date! <i>(he steps back).<p>
<p>
The Black Knight basically launches himself at Dave, who does all he can (at
least at first)  to keep the Knight's blade from cleaving him in Twain (or
whatever dorm has block tickets for that night).  As soon as he recovers the
fight becomes much less one-sided and it is actually a superbly staged,
fantastic, brilliant, amazing sword fight.  Throughout the fight, the director
has cleverly inserted sound effects from the MacGame &quot;Dark Castle&quot;.  You know
what we mean, so just do it. Sword fights are great.  Especially when they
appear really dangerous.  The audience really gets into it.  Eventually, the
tide of battle turns and Dave is about to bite the big one, when April
(apparantly none too happy about this threat to the life of her would-be
significant-other) walks up to the BK from behind and gives him a shot of mace
from her purse.  Shrieking and blinded, the BK runs off.  Dave looks stupidly
at his benefactor.  The sword feels really heavy.</i><p>
<b><p>
April:</b>  Gee, Dave, guess you should have taken that SWOPSI self-defense
class, eh?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis:</b>  OK, this is swell and all, but how are we going to get back to...<p>
<i><p>
POOF!  With a flash of smoke and an orchestra once-through of the &quot;Monty Python
and the Holy Grail&quot; music, Dean Jean Fetter appears in cameo #2 at the other
end of the stage, dressed up as a wizard with silly cloak and hat, adorned with
moons, stars, etc.</i><p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>  All right now <i>(HW note -- groan!)</i>  is there anyone here who
wants to get into Stanford?<p>
<b><p>
Dave:</b>  Oh, Dean Fetter... I'd write a million essays to get out of this
dump.  <i>He and Elvis approach her.  Meanwhile, the peitioner accosts April
and separates her from the guys.</i><p>
<b><p>
Petitioner:</b>  Oh, wait!  You're the last signature I need to get a real
date?  Would you sign this for me... pleeeeeeeeeeese?  <i>(he gives her the
sad, pleading puppy-dog face.  She can't resist)</i><p>
<b><p>
April:</b>  Oh hell.  All right, where's the pen?<i>  Meanwhile, the guys are
back at the cameo...</i><p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>  Halt!  What... is your name?<p>
<b><p>
Dave:</b>  Uh, I'm Dave and this is Elvis.<p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>  What... is your quest?<p>
<b><p>
Elvis:</b>  To get out of this scene... and get our pizza!<p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>  What... were your SAT scores?<p>
<b><p>
Dave:</b>  Well, I had a 1480...<p>
<b><p>
Elvis:</b>  And I had a 1510!  Psych!<p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>  Great!  Bravo!  Off you go!  <i>(they scuttle off stage, away from
Jean's wrath.)</i><p>
<i><p>
April finishes signing the petition, and the petitioner runs off... right to
where Jean's standing.</i><p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>   Halt!  What is your name?<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner:</b> Uh... Eugene Milford Finklestein<p>
<b><p>
Jean: </b>What is your quest?<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner:</b> Oh... I'm gonna go on a date!<p>
<b><p>
Jean:  </b>What... is the most intellectually meaningful experience in your
life?<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner:</b> Oh, I don't know.<p>
<i><p>
Jean casts a spell on him and with a puff of light and smoke, he dies horribly.
Urchins run onstage and carry off his body.</i><p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>   Halt!  What is your name?<p>
<b><p>
April:</b> My name is April May June.<p>
<b><p>
Jean: </b>What is your quest?<p>
<b><p>
April:</b> I want to get back in the plot and save the Axe.<p>
<b><p>
Jean:  </b>What...one-word adjective best describes you?<p>
<b><p>
Petitioner:</b> Well, is strong-willed one word or two?<p>
<b><p>
Jean:</b>  Oh heck, I don't know.<p>
<i><p>
Flash, smoke, and Jean dies too.  April runs off to catch up with Dave and
Elvis.</i><p>

<a name="writers">THE WRITERS SCENE:</a></b> <i>(as Dave, April and Elvis emerge from the &quot;Love
Connection &amp; Middle Ages Date&quot; scene, they see the writers, who are sitting
at a table at stage left.  Dave, April and Elvis start ditching the ridiculous
medieval garb which looks stupid anyways. The writers have a Mac, along with
every variety of snack food and alcoholic beverage imaginable.  They look like
hell.  The Head Writer is finishing off on the Mac, while the others don't even
notice the weenie who's also at the table.  The writers were going to play
themselves, but in the end we don't care if we're played by wrters, actors, or
Toons, as long as they remember their lines.</i><b><p>
<p>
H.W</b>. <i>(slowly, while typing):</i>  Curtain down.  <i>(curtain comes
down)</i>  The End.<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 1</b>:  Yay!  It's over!<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  The end?  What do you mean &quot;The End&quot;?<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 2:</b>  Rent a clue, babe!  Finished!  Over!  Completed!  Pick up your
beers and head for the exits!<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS:</b>  You've got to be kidding!<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 3:</b>  You know, this must be the best Gaieties ever.  The main
characters have a wonderful time the whole way through, the weenies lose,
everything's resolved, and we're all really nice to everyone for a change...
it's just like &quot;Bambi&quot; without the big forest fire.<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS:</b>  What the hell are you talking about?<p>
<b><p>
APRIL:  </b>You can't be serious!  Nothing is resolved!  The weenies still have
the axe and the axe committee.  And we have been miserable ever since we
ordered the pizza in scene one.  This isn't &quot;Bambi&quot; without the forest fire...
it's Bambi shot dead two minutes into the film and then strapped to the hood of
a pickup truck!<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS:</b>  Wow!  That's <u>exactly</u> what I would have said!<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 3.5</b>:  Wait.  You didn't like the &quot;Free Tuition Forever&quot; scene?  Or
the &quot;Led Zeppelin reunites and plays the coffee house&quot; scene?<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 3.75:</b>  Or &quot;The whole campus gets laid&quot; scene?<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS:</b>  We didn't see any of those scenes!<p>
<b><p>
DAVE:</b>  Or our pizza!<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 4:</b>  I don't get it.  It sounds as if you were in a totally different
Gaieties... and the only way that could happen is if you found a hole in our
plot.<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 5</b>:  Of if someone <i>else</i> got into our script!<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> <i>(walks behind weenie):</i>  O.K., Mr. Big Shot Writer.  Someone
else, huh?  Like maybe A WEENIE!!<i>  (grabs weenie from behind and makes him
stand up)</i><p>
<b><p>
WRITERS</b>:  GASP!!<p>
<b><p>
H.W.</b>:  You... changed... our... script!? <i>(getting mad)</i>  NOBODY
CHANGES OUR SCIPT, PAL!  <i>(grabs chainsaw from under table.  Starts it up and
stares at weenie.  Note that chainsaws are stagable and perfectly safe (I saw
the Tubes do it) </i><cite>if</cite><i> you remember to remove the chain before
running it near people).</i>  Anyone up for Wienershchnitzel?<p>
<b><p>
WEENIE</b>:  Vell, I zink it's time I be on my way and <i>(starts running)
</i>get ze fock out of here!  <i>(chased off stage by H.W.)</i><p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  O.K., well that explains how we got here.  But can we get the
Axe?<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Can we get something to eat, too?  I'm still hungry!<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 1</b>:  You want food, you got it.  <i>(types on Mac.  A banana is
dropped to Dave from above (or tossed from offstage))</i><p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  A banana, dude?  What can I do with a banana?<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 2 </b><i>(snarky):</i>  Use your imagination.<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Ha ha, guys.  What about the Axe?<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 3</b>:  Well, you're characters, and you're still here, so that means
the show's still running.<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 4:</b>  Which means that all you need to do is...<i>(alarm clock sound
effect)</i><p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  What the heck?<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 5</b>:  Oops.  The Gaieties cameo clock.  We gotta go, or else we become
actors.  <i>(writer comments:  Yuck, no way, inconceivable!)  </i>Good luck
with the finalé, guys.  <i>(they start packing up the table and moving
offstage)</i><p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Wait!  You can't leave!  I'll do anything to get the Axe back!<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 3</b>:  <b>Anything??</b><p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  I don't need the Axe <u>that</u> badly.<p>
<b><p>
WRITER 4</b>:  Then so long, guys.  Watch out for clichés!  <i>(they're
gone)</i><p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Clichés?  What do you mean?  What the heck are we gonna do?
<i>(curtain up for finalé)</i><b><p>
<a name="finale">THE BIG FINALÉ:</a>  </b><i>(the continued rise of the curtain reveals a
decimated lounge, old and dusty (put dust on EVERYTHING, techies) with debris
strewn about.  Lots of furniture is covered by sheets)</i><p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Where the hell are we now?<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  Hey check this out!  (picks card off floor)  It's a draw card!
(read)  IT'S NUMBER 0001!<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Trashed lounge... draw card 1... we must be in Roble!<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  What a dump!  Who'd want to live here?  No wonder they shut the
damn place down.<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Wow, man, I haven't been here since I broke in to party with (looks
at APRIL, who's not impressed) never mind.<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  Well, let's split up... it'll be safer that way!<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> (sarcastic):  yeah, it worked wonders last time we did it!<b><p>
<p>
ELVIS</b>:  Well, this is the last scene, so we can't get in any more
trouble.<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  O.K., Elvis, you go that way and April and I'll go this way.<i><p>
<p>
(ELVIS walks to back of stage, poking around.  Sign drops down saying &quot;Romantic
Tension Comes To Head&quot;.  Perhaps some mushy music too)</i><p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b> (looks at sign):  Oh, no way...<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> (not looking at sign):  O.K., then go with Elvis.  I don't care.<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b> (turning to DAVE with major romantic tension):  Yes, you do.<p>
<b><p>
DAVE:</b> (his defenses now down):  I, uh, well...<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b> (approaching DAVE):  I'm sick of this!  You always act like you don't
care!  What are you afraid of?  <i>(ELVIS, leaning against a covered cabinet or
something, turns around to watch, as APRIL begins to seriously invade DAVE's
personal space)</i><p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> (his cover blown):  I'm...<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b> (sarcastic, and really hot):  Yeah, right.<p>
<i><p>
(they're almost close enough to switch gum (that means kiss, Jill, in case you
couldn't guess); ELVIS thinks this is really dumb)</i><p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  Oh my lip!  <p>
<i><p>
(ELVIS leans too hard on the cabinet.  He falls over, clutching at the cover
sheet.  He falls to the ground, sheet in hand, revealing the cabinet, which is
a huge blue and yellow computer console labelled &quot;OSKI ][&quot;.  DAVE and APRIL
turn around to see what ELVIS has just discovered)<p>
</i><b><p>
ALL</b> <i>(turning back to audience)</i>:  HOLY SHIT, BATMAN!  (again for
Matt)<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  That's why they closed Roble!  It's a weenie plot!<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Oh, don't say the p-word.  How 'bout &quot;scheme&quot;?<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  Oh, right.<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Well, what's the rest of this stuff?<p>
<i><p>
(They look.  They find file cabinets, computers, inflatable party girl dolls,
etc., all in mint condition.)  </i><p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b> (picking up papers from a desk): O.K., here's something about the
plo--, <i>scheme </i>to get the Axe!  <i>(APRIL and DAVE look over his
shoulder)</i>  It says &quot;Project Kiss My Axe, final status report.  All systems
go, proceeding as directed to rendezvous at <i>terra infirma</i> at designated
time during cheesy finalé scene in order to return via plot hole to
Mother Bear.&quot;<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  So, how do we stop them?<p>
<i><p>
(STAGEHANDS wheel gaudy-looking &quot;plot hole&quot; onto edge of stage left.  It's big
and bright and flashy and has streamers over the doorway in center and has
&quot;plot hole&quot; in purple letters over the top.)</i><p>
<b><p>
STAGEHAND #1</b>:  Anyone here order a plot hole?<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  No.<p>
<b><p>
ALL THREE</b>:  But we did order a pizza!<p>
<b><p>
STAGEHAND #2</b>:  That ain't our department.  And we gotta have someone sign
for this hole.  We can't just leave it here.<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Oh, O.K., no problem (takes clipboard, signs).  Thanks guys!<p>
<b><p>
STAGEHANDS</b>:  Sure, see ya!  (they exuent)<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  You idiot!  You just bought the weenies their ticket back to
Berkeley with our Axe!<p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  Great!  Now what are we going to do?<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to help.  Darn it!  If only we had
something to trip 'em up with!  <i>(upset, he flailing his arms in a temper
tantrum)</i>  If only we had... <i>(notices banana peel in left hand, sound
effect:  DING!, light bulb appears over head, Hi Jill!)</i> if only, if only...
(pause)  Uh, do you guys remember what the writers said about clichés?<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Yeah, so what?<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b> <i>(holds banana peel up)</i>:  I think I just found it.<p>

<p>
DAVE</b>:  Here they come!<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Quick!  Behind the plot hole!<p>
<i><p>
(they duck behind the plot hole, with DAVE looking around one side.  Sure
enough, the WEENIES appear on opposite side of stage, with Axe and Axe
Committee still attached.  One points at the plot hole and they race towards
it)</i><p>

APRIL</b>:  Dave, now!<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Control your urges, April!<p>

DAVE</b>:  Oh... <i>(tosses peel in path of weenies who, of course, hit it
simultaneously and fall stupidly)</i><p>
<b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  It's ours!<p>
<i><p>
(DAVE, APRIL, and ELVIS, along with the AXE COMMITTEE, wrest control of the Axe
from the WEENIES.  Disoriented, the WEENIES try to stand, facing the plot hole
instead of their attackers)<p>
</i><b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Back to Bezerkeley, scum!  <i>(kicks weenies from behind, forcing
them through plot hole, hooray!  Please see to it that the plot hole is so big
that the weenies cannot miss and hit the side and/or knock it over)</i><p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  Dave!  That was magnificent!<p>
<b><p>
DAVE</b>:  Nah, if you think about it, the banana's a stupid idea, almost as
lame as the plot holes were in the first place.<p>
<b><p>
APRIL</b>:  No, silly, I mean you.  <i>(sign appears:  HERE IT COMES)<p>
</i><b><p>
ELVIS</b>:  Oh, no.  I'm going home.<p>
<i><p>
(APRIL and DAVE have started a major smooching episode.  It's just
awful.)</i><p>

<a name="version-info">Information on this version</a>
<p>
This version of the script -- the only one found on diskette after an exhaustive search -- is a major rewrite done during the Summer of 1988.  Three sections were missing and transcribed from videotape:  Dean Jean's cameo, parts of the Writers Scene, and a bit of the Finale.  Also, since songs were written by the composers over the summer, only one of them appears here.
<p>
A few things were changed in production, but it is largely representative of the show as produced...
<p>
...and it <u>was</u> like Bambi without the big forest fire!
<p>
--Chris Adamson, January 1995
