<p>Stanford University&#146;s student-run Ram&#146;s Head Theatrical Society is proud to
announce its latest production, <b><i>Original Winter One Acts 1999</i>, </b>opening at
the Nitery Theatre on January 15, 1999. <b><i>Original Winter One Acts</i> </b>is a
revolutionary showcase of writing, artistic production and performance talent. The
performance presents the best work of Stanford&#146;s most talented student writers,
directors, and actors. Two remarkable student-written plays debut this year.</p>

<p><i>Petersburg</i> is the story of an apartment manager who must confront his family and
friends after the death of a famous piano-playing tenant. Set in Russia, this remarkable
first play of writer <b>James Copeland</b>, a Stanford junior majoring in English,
explores the borderless issues of responsibility, the meaning of true friendship, and the
perception of life&#146;s worth. Sophomore director <b>Kingsley Willis</b> has led an
all-star cast towards a truly memorable and amazing dramatic production.</p>

<p><i>Dice</i> asks how you would survive the pain of kidnapping, the torture of beatings,
the humiliation of interrogation, and the fear of eternal imprisonment. Written by <b>Mark
Ganek</b>, a junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering and English, this dark drama
follows two strangers as they are forced to jointly ask these questions&#133;and realize
that they do not like all the answers. Director <b>Alice May Bugman</b> and Ganek have
closely collaborated to create a fast-paced and thrilling theatrical experience.</p>

<p><i><b>Original Winter One Acts 1999</b></i> will be held in the Nitery Theatre in the
Old Union near Tresidder Student Union on the Stanford campus. The excitement begins
Friday, January 15<sup>th</sup> at 8pm. Additional performances will take place January
16, January 20, January 21, January 22, and January 23 at 8pm; and January 17, January 24
at 2pm. Tickets are $15/general admission, $8/Stanford students. Tickets can be purchased
at the door or in White Plaza between 11:30 am &#150; 1:30 pm every day during opening
week. For further information, please call (650) 723-0801.</p>
