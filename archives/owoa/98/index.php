<h2>Show Synopses</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>
  <font color="ff0000"><b><p>&quot;Texas and Tom&quot;</b></font>, written by Ilana Weiner
  and directed by Erryn Lewis, is the brilliant story of Tennessee Williams and Margo Jones,
  the amazing woman who helped to make his plays a success. The story of their relationship
  is told by mirroring the events and themes of &quot;The Glass Menagerie.&quot; It is a
  show about fast paced lifestyles, quick talking, and the road to success. The play crosses
  boundaries of time, space, and genre which make it visually appealing and exciting to
  watch. </p>
  <p><font color="ff0000"><b>&quot;Solitaire for Two&quot;</b></font>, written by Jeremy
  Sawyer and directed by Ana-Catrina Savulescu, is about solitude and solidarity, blurry
  dilemmas of fantasy and reality, and living with the death of love. It is a struggle in
  the face of ultimate mystery. Soren goes to bed with his nagging wife, Margaret. He wakes
  the next morning to discover a mysterious and beautiful woman whom he has never seen
  before in his bed. Things escalate from there. Meanwhile, in another world, an old man
  named Fred and a younger Bill play solitaire with their own decks and talk of love,
  spirits, and perverse dreams. </p>
  <p><font color="ff0000"><b>&quot;Shakespeare's Sonnets&quot;</b></font>, written by Samuel
  Park and directed by Dan Pintauro, follows 50 years in the lives of two gay men, together
  and apart, as they live through the oppressive McCarthy years and discover a world of
  pain, love, and desire. It's about the moments that we remember, and the things we can't
  forget. It's 1948 and Jean is discovering in college the things that he likes best:
  theatre, Shakespeare's sonnets, and his friend Adam. These are also the things that, for
  the rest of his life, will keep his heart afloat, and ablaze. </p>

  <p>More coming soon... cast, send your bio's to <a href="mailto:jstabaco@leland.stanford.edu">jstabaco@leland</a>! :) </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>Peter Douglas</b></font> (&quot;Texas and Tom&quot;) - Peter is
  excited to be making his Ram's Head debut in the 1998 Winter One Acts production of
  &quot;Texas and Tom.&quot; This is Peter's first year at Stanford and only his second
  theatrical production. Stanford theatre-goers might recognize him from <u>Twelfth Night</u>,
  in which Peter played Valentine and a very dangerous-looking thug. Peter's most recent
  work includes the title role in <u>Hamlet</u> at Interlochen Center for the Arts in
  Michigan, Martin Dyshart in <u>Equus</u> at the National Cathedral School in Washington,
  D.C., and Stuckley in <u>The Castle</u> at the British American Drama Academy in Oxford,
  England. Peter is looking forward to working with Ram's Head again in future productions
  and would like to thank his family for all their support over the years. </p>

<h2>Staff Bio's</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>
  <p>More coming soon... staff, send your bio's to <a href="mailto:jstabaco@leland.stanford.edu">jstabaco@leland</a>! :) </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>Julie Cuevas</b></font> (Producer) - Julie joined Ram's Head
  her freshman year as Laura Ingalls Wilder in Gaieties '94. There she learned new games to
  play with bananas. :) She then went on to appear in Original Winter One Acts '95 and '97.
  She loved OWOA so much that she decided to try her hand at producing it, and that's where
  she is now. She'll also be choreographing the <u>Chess</u> moves this year. Can't escape
  Ram's Head and doesn't want to. :) </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>Megan Fuller-Deets</b></font> (Stage Manager) - Megan worked on
  this year's Gaieties for Ram's Head and <u>Twelfth Night</u> for the Drama Department and
  will also be the assistant stage manager for <u>Chess</u> in the spring. She admits to
  being suicidal and addicted to theatre and would like to thank her family and friends who
  only see her two weeks a term and love her anyway. </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>John Lim</b></font> (Advertising/Publicity Manager) has
  recently joined Ram's Head as a freshman, planning to major in Psychology and minoring in
  Drama. He loves publicity and has a special bond with fax machines. He is very happy to be
  a part of a wonderful show and hopes you enjoy it. </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>Jenny Moon</b></font> (Asst. Director, &quot;Solitaire for
  Two&quot;) - This is Jenny's first involvement with a Ram's Head production other than
  Gaieties. She'd like to think it's the first step in escaping the Gaieties machine, but if
  she thought that, she'd be wrong. She would be thinking the right thing, only it's the
  complete opposite. </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>Samuel Park</b></font> (Writer, &quot;Shakespeare's
  Sonnets&quot;) is a senior majoring in English. &quot;Shakespeare's Sonnets&quot; is his
  second Ram's Head Winter One Act, having written and directed one for the Drama Department
  last year. Writing for him is a way to save money from therapy and to share something --
  good or bad -- with other people. </p>
  <p><font color="0000ff"><b>Ana-Catrina Savulescu</b></font> (Director, &quot;Solitaire for
  Two&quot;) - Ana-Catrina, also known as the Princess of Romania, is a sophomore in Human
  Biology. She was stage manager for OWOA last year, when she spent a lot of time watching
  rehearsals and learning about the &quot;other side of the curtain&quot; in theatre. This
  year she was NOT going to get involved with Ram's Head, because it's her HumBio core year;
  but passing by the Green Room, she made the mistake of reading Jeremy Sawyer's script for
  &quot;Solitaire for Two.&quot; Next thing she knew, she was directing it, and loving it. </p>
